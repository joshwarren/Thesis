\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}
	\label{cha:conclusion}
The progenitors to early-type galaxies (ETGs) are thought to be formed in the early universe in single cataclysmic collapses, undergoing intense star formation, before being rapidly quenched at some point in their history. One suggested method by which this could occur is feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), whereby AGN strip the galaxies of most of their gas available for star formation and subsequently stop replenishing of these gas reservoirs from cooling hot gas. Primarily this means removing the atomic and molecular (collectively cold) gas, but it is observed that ionized (warm) gas is also only present in ETGs in very small quantities. Indeed many semi-analytic models and numerical simulations require such feedback in order to reproduce the known properties of ETGs \citep[e.g.][]{Kauffmann2000, DiMatteo2005, Springel2005, Bower2006}. 

It is becoming increasingly clear that there are two types of AGN: radiation-mode and jet-mode AGN \citep[e.g.][]{Antonucci2012}. \citet{Heckman2014} suggest that a radiation-mode AGN is a single event in the life of a massive galaxy, which expels much of the gas and halts star formation. Jet-mode AGN then maintain this state, stopping the re-accretion or cooling of gas, such that the host galaxy cannot restart star formation. These AGN have cycles of short activity followed by longer quiescent phases. Radio galaxies (where the radio emission is not due to stellar processes such as star formation or supernova) are one marker of the active phase of jet-mode AGN. If jet-mode AGN are indeed ordinary ETGs in an active phase, then we would expect samples of radio galaxies to be no different from optically-selected samples of ETGs. 

To test this hypothesis, we use a sample of radio-selected ETGs, first constructed in \citet[; hereafter the Southern sample]{Prandoni2010}. We describe our observations and those from the literature for each galaxy within the sample in Appendix \ref{cha:Description}. In Chapter \ref{cha:stellar}, we observe the stellar kinematics and populations of our Southern sample. We compare known characteristics of optically-selected ETGs to our observations using the Atlas$^\text{3D}$ and MASSIVE surveys as control samples. Firstly we classify our Southern sample in to fast and slow rotators. We show that, after correcting for mass, there is a similar fraction of slow rotators in our Southern sample to the optically selected surveys. We also show that, like the general population of ETGs, most of the Southern sample are old, metal rich and alpha-element enhanced. The exceptions are NGC 612 and NGC 1316, both of which have considerably younger stellar populations ($\approx 4$ and $\approx 2$\,Gyr, respectively) that dominate their luminosities. 

In Chapter \ref{cha:gas} we observe the distribution, kinematics and ionization of the warm gas in our Southern sample. Again, this is compared to observations made by the Atlas$^\text{3D}$ project. We first estimate the mass of \ion{H}{ii} in each galaxy and find a range from $10^4$--$10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ which is at the upper limit expected in optically-selected ETGs. This is the only suggestion we find that the sample may be intrinsically different to optically selected ETGs (other than the radio detection). Higher gas masses would be consistent with higher detection rates of different components (cold gas and dust) of the interstellar medium \citep[ISM; e.g.][]{DeRuiter2002, Leon2003, VerdoesKleijn2005}. We detect spatially-extended ionized gas in only 4 galaxies in our Southern sample. Of these, two (NGC 612 and NGC 1316) have aligned angular momentum vectors with the kinematics of the stars (although NGC 1316 could also be consistent with a misalignment). The other two (IC 1459 and NGC 3100) both show clear misalignment. NGC 3100 has particularly interesting substructures, with two peaks in intensity which are spatially coincident with the radio lobes and in the breaks of the ring of CO (discussed in more detail in Appendix \ref{cha:Description}). IC 1459 has gas counter-rotating with respect to its kinematically-decoupled core (KDC) suggestion it was accreted onto the galaxy in an event after the merger which formed the KDC. 
% while we suggest that IC 1459 may have re-accreted the gas lost in the merger which formed the kinematically-decoupled core (KDC). In this way, the observed gas in IC 1459 may have originated from inside the progenitor galaxy, despite it's kinematics being apparently decoupled from the rest of the galaxy. 

Finally, we use the \citet[; BPT]{Baldwin1981} plots, and other similar diagnostic plots such as the SAURON \citep{Sarzi2010}, H\,$\alpha$ equivalent width verse [\ion{N}{ii}]/H\,$\alpha$ \citep[WHaN2;][]{CidFernandes2011}, H\,$\alpha$ radial profile and mass--excitation \citep[MEx;][]{Nyland2016} plots in order to classify the galaxies in our Southern sample based on the dominant source of the ionizing radiation field. We find that 2 of our Southern sample (IC 1531 and NGC 3100) are classified as Seyfert 2s; 7 are LINERs, 4 of which we attribute the ionizing potential to the radiation field from to the AGN. The emission lines required to classify the galaxies in this way are not detected for the remaining two galaxies (ESO 443-G24 and PKS 718-34). These are consistent with the fractions found by \citet{Nyland2016}.

All of these results suggest that our radio-selected galaxies are very similar to radio-quiet ETGs in all defining characteristics accessible to study within $V$-band data. This supports with the hypothesis that radio activity is a normal phase in the duty cycle of massive ETGs. 

The only difference that we observe is slightly higher \ion{H}{ii} masses in radio galaxies than in optically selected ETGs. This may be explained by approximations made during the flux calibration. However if true, shows that radio galaxies either have more total gas or more ionized gas, suggesting a stronger ionizing radiation field from the AGN. Both scenarios might be expected if the galaxy is in the process of reheating gas allowed to cool in quiescent phase. 

Two galaxies of the sample that are potential outliers are NGC 612 and NGC 1316. Both galaxies are fast rotators, with spatially-extended, ionized gas which is aligned kinematically to the angular momentum vector of the stars. This, along with their high ellipticities suggest that they are both intrinsically axisymmetric (disc) galaxies. It is well known that disc radio galaxies are rare, with only a handful known \citep[e.g.][]{Heckman1982, Ledlow1998, Hota2011a, Morganti2011, Mao2015}. This suggests that while the formation of jet-mode AGN does not explicitly require a dry major merger (which destroys the disc resulting in a slow rotator and expels internal gas reservoirs), such an event significantly enhances the likelihood of it occurring. 

\section{Future Work}
	\label{sec:future}
	With this data set, it may be possible to produce dynamical Jeans Anisotropic Models (\textsc{jam}\footnote{\url{http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~mxc/software/\#jam}}) using the methods by \citet{Cappellari2008}. This would give an accurate estimation of the inclination and the total mass of the galaxies in our sample which would allow us to study the mass-to-light ratios as well as compare quantities of gas as a fraction of total mass. Having said that, the VIMOS data may not be of sufficient quality: the offsets between the VIMOS quadrants may cause the \textsc{jam} routine to fail. 

	We already have observation for 9 out of 11 galaxies in the sample with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The moment-0 measurements for \ce{^{12}CO(2-1)} are overlaid on all maps in this thesis, and further work on these observation is currently being carried out Ruffa (in prep.). A comparison between the kinematics of the CO and the ionized gas should be made once this is complete. In particular, NGC 3100 shows interesting, non-spatially coincident structures in both the ionized gas maps and the molecular gas. This seems to be direct observation of feedback from the AGN via the radio jets. 

	In order to observed the final phase of the ISM, the hot (X-ray) gas, it would be useful to get X-ray observation from the \textit{Chandra Observatory}. Some observations of our sample already exist within the literature: IC 1459 was observed by \citet{Fabbiano2003}, IC 4296 by \citet{Pellegrini2002}, NGC 1316 by \citet{Lanz2010}, NGC 3557 by \citet{Ponman2001} (first published by \citealt{Balmaverde2005}) and several observations of NGC 1399 are available \citep[e.g.][]{Su2017}. Many have already noted X-ray cavities apparently created by the radio jets as evidence for AGN feedback by these systems. The size of these cavities can be used to estimate the energy imparted to the hot gas from the radio jets, and by assuming some efficiency we can thereby estimate the power contained in the jet. Additionally, the accretion power can be probed using the X-ray luminosity of the point source (AGN) at the centre of the galaxy, which can be directly compared to the radio jet power.

	The cold gas (via \ce{^{12}CO(2-1)}) observations from ALMA, the warm gas and stellar observations from this thesis and the proposed above hot gas from \textit{Chandra} observations would together provide a systematic study similar to the Atlas$^\text{3D}$ project. This allows for direct comparisons between our radio-selected sample and the optically-selected Atlas$^\text{3D}$. 

	Finally, a major improvement would be to re-observe to survey area with the VLA to add any missing galaxies to turn this sample into a volume-limited sample (currently the sample is defined by apparent radio flux density and apparent magnitude as well as redshift). This would remove any bias towards high mass galaxies that is inherent in our current sample.
