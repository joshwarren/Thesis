Well here, we are. I have dreamed about doing a PhD in astrophysics for most of my life. Sure it's always different to how you first imagine it, in fact it has been the hard thing of my entire life but I have no regret for following my dream. However, success has been dependent on quite a large number of people who I would like to include here. 

Firstly to Mrs Armitage - my narrowboat - for looking after me, keeping me going and teaching me to slow down and enjoy life whatever it throws at you. 

To my family, thank you for all your love and encouragement to keep going.

To friends wherever you are, thanks. Thanks for pub trips, physics discussions,

Finally, to my wife Annie. This thesis belongs as much to you as it does to me. Without you this certainly wouldn't have happened. You believed in me when I didn't and made huge sacrifices for this DPhil, despite not having chosen it. I cannot thank you enough, and I'm not sure I will ever pay back the washing up debt I owe! I love you. ``To the stars... and who says we have to come back?''
