abstract = {The recent literature suggests that an evolutionary dichotomy exists for early-type galaxies (Es and S0s, ETGs) whereby their central photometric structure (cuspy versus core central luminosity profiles), and figure of rotation (fast (FR) vs. slow (SR) rotators), are determined by whether they formed by "wet" or "dry" mergers. We consider whether the mid infrared (MIR) properties of ETGs, with their sensitivity to accretion processes in particular in the last few Gyr (on average z {\textless} 0.2), can put further constraints on this picture. We investigate a sample of 49 ETGs for which nuclear MIR properties and detailed photometrical and kinematical classifications are available from the recent literature. In the stellar light cuspy/core ETGs show a dichotomy that is mainly driven by their luminosity. However in the MIR, the brightest core ETGs show evidence that accretions have triggered both AGN and star formation activity in the recent past, challenging a "dry" merger scenario. In contrast, we do find, in the Virgo and Fornax clusters, that cuspy ETGs, fainter than M{\$}{\_}{\{}K{\_}s{\}}=-24{\$}, are predominantly passively evolving in the same epoch, while, in low density environments, they tend to be more active. A significant and statistically similar fraction of both FR (38{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+18{\}}{\_}{\{}-11{\}}{\$}$\backslash${\%}) and SR (50{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+34{\}}{\_}{\{}-21{\}}{\$}$\backslash${\%}) shows PAH features in their MIR spectra. Ionized and molecular gas are also frequently detected. Recent star formation episodes are then a common phenomenon in both kinematical classes, even in those dominated by AGN activity, suggesting a similar evolutionary path in the last few Gyr. MIR spectra suggest that the photometric segregation between cuspy and core nuclei and the dynamical segregation between FR and SR must have originated before z{\~{}}0.2.},

abstract = {We study the optical colors of 147,920 galaxies brighter than g* = 21, observed in five bands by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over {\~{}}100 deg2 of high Galactic latitude sky along the celestial equator. The distribution of galaxies in the g*-r* versus u*-g* color-color diagram is strongly bimodal, with an optimal color separator of u*-r* = 2.22. We use visual morphology and spectral classification of subsamples of 287 and 500 galaxies, respectively, to show that the two peaks correspond roughly to early- (E, S0, and Sa) and late-type (Sb, Sc, and Irr) galaxies, as expected from their different stellar populations. We also find that the colors of galaxies are correlated with their radial profiles, as measured by the concentration index and by the likelihoods of exponential and de Vaucouleurs' profile fits. While it is well known that late-type galaxies are bluer than early-type galaxies, this is the first detection of a local minimum in their color distribution. In all SDSS bands, the counts versus apparent magnitude relations for the two color types are significantly different and demonstrate that the fraction of blue galaxies increases toward the faint end.},

abstract = {(Abridge): We present a spectroscopic study of the stellar populations of Low Luminosity AGN (LLAGN). Our main goal is to determine whether the stars who live in the innermost (100 pc-scale) regions of these galaxies are in some way related to the emission line properties, which would imply a link between the stellar population and the ionization mechanism. High signal to noise, ground based long-slit spectra in the 3500--5500 A interval were collected for 60 galaxies.Our main findings are: (1) Few LLAGN have a detectable young ({\textless} 10 Myr) starburst component, indicating that very massive stars do not contribute significantly to the optical continuum. In particular, no features due to Wolf-Rayet stars were convincingly detected. (2) High Order Balmer absorption lines of HI (HOBLs), on the other hand, are detected in 40{\%} of LLAGN. These features, which are strongest in 100 Myr--1 Gyr intermediate age stellar populations, are accompanied by diluted metal absorption lines and bluer colors than other objects in the sample. (3) These intermediate age populations are very common (50 {\%}) in LLAGN with relatively weak [OI] emission, but rare (10 {\%}) in LLAGN with stronger [OI]. This is intriguing since LLAGN with weak [OI] have been previously hypothesized to be ``transition objects'' in which both an AGN and young stars contribute to the emission-line excitation. Massive stars, if present, are completely outshone by intermediate age and old stars in the optical. This happens in at least a couple of objects where independent UV spectroscopy detects young starbursts not seen in the optical. (4) Objects with predominantly old stars span the whole range of [OI]/Halpha values, but (5) sources with significant young and/or intermediate age populations are nearly all (90{\%}) weak [OI] emitters.},

abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope blue spectra at intermediate spectral resolution for the nuclei of 23 nearby disk galaxies. These objects were selected to have nebular emission in their nuclei, and span a range of emission-line classifications as well as Hubble types. In this paper we focus on the stellar population as revealed by the continuum spectral energy distribution measured within the central 0."13 ({\~{}}8pc) of these galaxies. The data were modeled with linear combinations of single-age stellar population synthesis models. The large majority ({\~{}}80{\%}) of the surveyed nuclei have spectra whose features are consistent with a predominantly old ({\textgreater}5x10{\^{}}9 yr) stellar population. Approximately 25{\%} of these nuclei show evidence of a component with age younger than 1 Gyr, with the incidence of these stars related to the nebular classification. Successful model fits imply an average reddening corresponding to A{\_}V{\~{}}0.4 mag and stellar metallicity of (1--2.5) Z{\_}sun. We discuss the implications of these results for the understanding of star formation history in the environment of quiescent and active supermassive black holes. Our findings reinforce the picture wherein Seyfert nuclei and the majority of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) are predominantly accretion-powered, and suggest that much of the central star formation in Hii nuclei is actually circumnuclear.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract We discuss the present observational and theoretical understanding of the stellar populations of bulges and their implications for galaxy formation and evolution. The place of bulges as key to the Hubble Sequence remains secure, but some old paradigms are giving way to new ones as observations develop. Detailed studies of Local Group bulges and haloes provide a basis on which we consider higher redshift data. We present the evidence for and against the currently common preconceptions that bulges are old, above solar metallicity in the mean, and simply scaled-down versions of ellipticals. We conclude life is not so simple: Bulges are diverse and heterogeneous, and although their properties vary systematically, sometimes they are reminiscent of disks, sometimes of ellipticals. The extant observational data are, however, limited. New and future surveys will rectify this, and we discuss the questions those data will address.},

We use collisionless {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater} body simulations to test the assumption that initially the surface brightness profiles of all bulges were exponential, and that the steepening of the profiles toward the early-types is due to satellite accretion. The results are positive. After the accretion of a satellite, bulge-disk fits show that the bulge grows and that the bulge profile index {\textless}i{\textgreater}n{\textless}i/{\textgreater} increases proportional to the satellite mass. For a satellite as massive as the bulge, {\textless}i{\textgreater}n{\textless}i/{\textgreater} rises from 1 to 4. We present kinematic diagnostics on the remnants and disk thickening. The latter suggests that the bulge growth must have occurred before the last formation of a thin disk in the galaxy. The thick disks created by the merger are reminiscent of thick disks seen in early-type edge-on galaxies. The efficiency of the process suggests that present day bulges of late-type spirals showing exponential profiles cannot have grown significantly by collisionless mergers.},

Only weak correlations between the classical optical parameters and isophote shapes are found. In contrast, there exist striking relations between the isophote shapes and the radio- and X-ray properties of elliptical galaxies. Objects which are radio-loud and/or surrounded by gaseous X-ray halos generally have boxy or irregular isophotes. Elliptical galaxies with pointed isophotes are mostly radio-quiet and show no X-ray emission in excess of the discrete source contribution. Elliptical galaxies with box-shaped or irregular isophotes seem to have systematically higher mass-to-light ratios than ellipticals with weak disk components.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull Algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and Delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it uses less memory. Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick ” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

In this paper we present resolved kinematics and star formation rates for 584 z{\~{}}1 galaxies. This constitutes the largest near-infrared Integral Field Unit survey of galaxies at z{\~{}}1 to date. We demonstrate the success of our selection criteria with 90{\%} of our targets found to be Halpha emitters, of which 81{\%} are spatially resolved. The fraction of the resolved KROSS sample with dynamics dominated by ordered rotation is found to be 83{\$}\backslashpm{\$}5{\%}. However, when compared with local samples these are turbulent discs with high gas to baryonic mass fractions, {\~{}}35{\%}, and the majority are consistent with being marginally unstable (Toomre Q{\~{}}1). There is no strong correlation between galaxy averaged velocity dispersion and the total star formation rate, suggesting that feedback from star formation is not the origin of the elevated turbulence. We postulate that it is the ubiquity of high (likely molecular) gas fractions and the associated gravitational instabilities that drive the elevated star-formation rates in these typical z{\~{}}1 galaxies, leading to the ten-fold enhanced star-formation rate density. Finally, by comparing the gas masses obtained from inverting the star-formation law with the dynamical and stellar masses, we infer an average dark matter to total mass fraction within 2.2{\$}r{\_}e{\$} (9.5kpc) of 65{\$}\backslashpm{\$}12{\%}, in agreement with the results from hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We present adaptive optics assisted, spatially resolved spectroscopy of a sample of nine H-alpha-selected galaxies at z=0.84--2.23 drawn from the HiZELS narrow-band survey. These galaxies have star-formation rates of 1-27Mo/yr and are therefore representative of the typical high-redshift star-forming population. Our {\~{}}kpc-scale resolution observations show that approximately half of the sample have dynamics suggesting that the ionised gas is in large, rotating disks. We model their velocity fields to infer the inclination-corrected, asymptotic rotational velocities. We use the absolute B-band magnitudes and stellar masses to investigate the evolution of the B-band and stellar mass Tully-Fisher relationships. By combining our sample with a number of similar measurements from the literature, we show that, at fixed circular velocity, the stellar mass of star-forming galaxies has increased by a factor 2.5 between z=2 and z=0, whilst the rest-frame B-band luminosity has decreased by a factor {\~{}}6 over the same period. Together, these demonstrate a change in mass-to-light ratio in the B-band of Delta(M/L{\_}B)/(M/L{\_}B){\_}(z=0) $\backslash$sim 3.5 between z=1.5 and z=0, with most of the evolution occurring below z=1. We also use the spatial variation of [NII]/Halpha to show that the metallicity of the ionised gas in these galaxies declines monotonically with galacto-centric radius, with an average Delta(log O/H)/DeltaR=-0.027+/-0.005dex/kpc. This gradient is consistent with predictions for high-redshift disk galaxies from cosmologically based hydrodynamic simulations.},

abstract = {We have recently shown that X-ray observations of the population of `low-excitation' radio galaxies, which includes most low-power, Fanaroff-Riley class I sources as well as some more powerful Fanaroff-Riley class II objects, are consistent with a model in which the active nuclei of these objects are not radiatively efficient at any waveband. In another recent paper, Allen et al. have shown that Bondi accretion of the hot, X-ray emitting phase of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is sufficient to power the jets of several nearby, low-power radio galaxies at the centres of clusters. In this paper, we combine these ideas and suggest that accretion of the hot phase of the IGM is sufficient to power all low-excitation radio sources, while high-excitation sources are powered by accretion of cold gas that is in general unrelated to the hot IGM. This model explains a number of properties of the radio-loud active galaxy population, and has important implications for the energy input of radio-loud active galactic nuclei into the hot phase of the IGM: the energy supply of powerful high-excitation sources does not have a direct connection to the hot phase.},

abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance LCDM cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those AGN that lie at the centre of a quasistatic X-ray emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models which might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

@article{VanVelzen2012,
abstract = {To understand the feedback of black holes on their environment or the acceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the present cosmic epoch, a systematic, all-sky inventory of radio galaxies in the local universe is needed. Here we present the first catalog of radio-emitting galaxies that meets this requirement. Our catalog allows the selection of volume-limited subsamples containing all low-power radio galaxies, similar to the prototypical low-power radio galaxies Cen A or M87, within some hundred Mpc. It is constructed by matching radio emission from the NVSS and SUMSS surveys to galaxies of the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) using an image-level algorithm that properly treats the extended structure of radio sources. The sample contains 575 radio-emitting galaxies with a flux greater than 213 mJy at 1.4 GHz. Over 30{\%} of the galaxies in our catalog are not contained in existing large-area extra-galactic radio samples. We compute the optical and radio luminosity functions and the fraction of radio galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity. We find that the galaxy density around radio galaxies is significantly higher than around non-radio galaxies of the same luminosity and morphology. This enhanced clustering suggests a causal relation between external galaxy properties, such as environment or merger history, and the formation of powerful jets in the present universe. Since the enhancement is observed with respect to galaxies of the same luminosity and Hubble type, it is not primarily driven by black hole mass. Our automated matching procedure is found to select radio-emitting galaxies with high efficiency (99{\%}) and purity (91{\%}), which is key for future processing of deeper, larger samples.},

abstract = {GLEAM, the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA survey, is a survey of the entire radio sky south of declination + 25° at frequencies between 72 and 231 MHz, made with the MWA using a drift scan method that makes efficient use of the MWA's very large field-of-view. We present the observation details, imaging strategies, and theoretical sensitivity for GLEAM. The survey ran for two years, the first year using 40-kHz frequency resolution and 0.5-s time resolution; the second year using 10-kHz frequency resolution and 2 s time resolution. The resulting image resolution and sensitivity depends on observing frequency, sky pointing, and image weighting scheme. At 154 MHz, the image resolution is approximately 2.5 × 2.2/cos ($\delta$ + 26.7°) arcmin with sensitivity to structures up to {\~{}} 10° in angular size. We provide tables to calculate the expected thermal noise for GLEAM mosaics depending on pointing and frequency and discuss limitations to achieving theoretical noise in Stokes I images. We discuss challenges, and their solutions, that arise for GLEAM including ionospheric effects on source positions and linearly polarised emission, and the instrumental polarisation effects inherent to the MWA's primary beam.},

Aimed at producing a reliable compact source survey, our automated data reduction pipeline efficiently processed more than 2000 h of observations with minimal human interaction. Through application of innovative techniques such as image-based flagging, direction-dependent calibration of ionospheric phase errors, correcting for systematic offsets in antenna pointing, and improving the primary beam model, we created good quality images for over 95 percent of the 5336 pointings. Our data release covers 36 900 deg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} (or 3.6 {\textless}i{\textgreater}$\pi${\textless}i/{\textgreater} steradians) of the sky between −53° and +90° declination (Dec), which is 90 percent of the total sky. The majority of pointing images have a noise level below 5 mJy beam{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} with an approximate resolution of 25′′×25′′ (or 25′′×25′′/ cos(Dec−19°) for pointings south of 19° declination). We have produced a catalog of 0.62 Million radio sources derived from an initial, high reliability source extraction at the seven sigma level. For the bulk of the survey, the measured overall astrometric accuracy is better than two arcseconds in right ascension and declination, while the flux density accuracy is estimated at approximately ten percent. Within the scope of the TGSS alternative data release (TGSS ADR) project, the source catalog, as well as 5336 mosaic images (5°×5°) and an image cutout service, are made publicly available at the CDS as a service to the astronomical community. Next to enabling a wide range of different scientific investigations, we anticipate that these survey products will provide a solid reference for various new low-frequency radio aperture array telescopes (LOFAR, LWA, MWA, SKA-low), and can play an important role in characterizing the epoch-of-reionisation (EoR) foreground. The TGSS ADR project aims at continuously improving the quality of the survey data products. Near-future improvements include replacement of bright source snapshot images with archival targeted observations, using new observations to fill the holes in sky coverage and replace very poor quality observational data, and an improved flux calibration strategy for less severely affected observational data.},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Since the first release of the LQAC (Large Quasar Astrometric Catalogue) a large number of quasars have been discovered through very dense observational surveys. As these objects constitute the cornerstones of modern astrometry by indicating quasi inertial directions, their spatial density and their astrometric quality must be studied in detail. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Following the same procedure as in this first release of the LQAC, our aim is to compile all the quasars recorded until the present date, with the best determination of their equatorial coordinates in the ICRS, i.e. with respect to the newly established ICRF2 and with the maximum of information concerning their physical properties (redshift, photometry, absolute magnitudes). {\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} First of all we made a substantial review of the definitions and properties of quasars and AGN (active galactic nuclei), because the differenciation of these objects is unclear in the literature, even for specialists. Then we carried out the cross-identification between the nine catalogs of quasars chosen for their accuracy and their huge number of objects, including all the available data related to magnitudes, radiofluxes, and redshifts. Moreover, we computed the absolute magnitude of our extragalactic objects by taking the recent studies concerning the galactic absorption into account. In addition, substantial improvements were made with respect to the first release of the LQAC. First, an LQAC name is given for each object based on its equatorial coordinates with respect to the ICRS, following a procedure that creates no ambiguity in the identification. Second the equatorial coordinates of the objects were recomputed more accurately according to the algorithms used for the elaboration of the Large Quasar Reference Frame (LQRF). Third we introduce a morphological classification for the objects that in particular clearly defines if the object is point-like or extended.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our final catalog, called LQAC-2, contains 187 504 quasars. This is roughly 65{\%} more than the 113 666 quasars recorded in the first version of the LQAC and a little more than the number of quasars recorded in the updated version of the V{\'{e}}ron-Cetty {\&} V{\'{e}}ron (2010, A{\&}A, 518, A10) catalog, which was the densest compilation of quasars up to now. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative improvements brought by our compilation, we discuss the homogeneity of the data and carry out statistical analysis of the spatial density and the distance to the closest neighbor. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The LQAC-2 will be useful for the astronomical community since it gives the most complete information available about the whole set of already recorded quasars, insisting on the precision and accuracy of their coordinates with respect to the ICRF-2.},

abstract = {A high angular resolution study of the nucleus of the FR I galaxy IC4296 using Chandra ACIS-S and VLBA observations is presented, with the aim of studying the nature of the accretion process. Pointlike and hard X-ray emission is found, well described by a moderately absorbed power law of Gamma=1.48{\^{}}{\{}+0.42{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.34{\}}; no iron fluorescence line from cold material is detected. The 0.3-10 keV luminosity is 2.4$\backslash$times 10{\^{}}{\{}41{\}} erg/s, that is $\backslash$sim 400 times lower than the accretion luminosity resulting from the estimated Bondi mass accretion rate and a radiative efficiency of 10{\%}. On the parsec scale a jet and a counter-jet extend out from a central unresolved ``core'' in the 8.4 GHz image. Their orientation is in good agreement with that of the large scale jets and their bulk speed is relativistic. The parsec scale spectrum is convex over 2-22 GHz. The observed nuclear luminosity is not likely to be reconciled with the accretion luminosity by assuming that Compton thick material surrounds the nucleus. Low radiative efficiency accretion flow models (ADAF and its variants) cannot account for the observed emission and spectral shape of the nucleus in the radio band. The power in the jets accounts for a sizable fraction ($\backslash$ga 10{\%}) of the accretion luminosity; therefore the mass accretion rate needs not to be much different from the estimate obtained using Bondi's theory. A jet dominated origin also for the observed radiative losses of the nucleus is suggested. This could also explain the finding that a nuclear luminosity orders of magnitude lower than that of ``normal'' radio loud AGNs is accompanied by a relatively higher radio emission.},

abstract = {We present a simple and efficient anisotropic generalization of the semi-isotropic (two-integral) axisymmetric Jeans formalism which is used to model the stellar kinematics of galaxies. The following is assumed: (i) a constant mass-to-light ratio M/L and (ii) a velocity ellipsoid that is aligned with cylindrical coordinates (R,z) and characterized by the classic anisotropy parameter beta{\_}z=1-sigma{\_}z{\^{}}2/sigma{\_}R{\^{}}2. Our simple models are fit to SAURON integral-field observations of the stellar kinematics for a set of fast-rotator early-type galaxies. With only two free parameters (beta{\_}z and the inclination) the models generally provide remarkably good descriptions of the shape of the first (V) and second (V{\_}rms=sqrt{\{}V{\^{}}2+sigma{\^{}}2{\}}) velocity moments, once a detailed description of the surface brightness is given. This is consistent with previous findings on the simple dynamical structure of these objects. With the observationally-motivated assumption that beta{\_}z{\textgreater}0, the method is able to recover the inclination. The technique can be used to determine the dynamical mass-to-light ratios and angular momenta of early-type fast-rotators and spiral galaxies, especially when the quality of the data does not justify more sophisticated modeling approaches. This formalism allows for the inclusion of dark matter, supermassive black holes, spatially varying anisotropy, and multiple kinematic components.},

The remainder of the volume is in bubble interiors, cavities, and tunnels of much lower density, with some but not all of those lower density regions hot enough to be observable via their X-ray emission. This entire system is pervaded by a rather strong and irregular magnetic field and cosmic rays, the pressures of which are confined by the weight of the interstellar gas, particularly that far from the plane where gravity is strong. Observations suggest that the cosmic rays and magnetic field have an even more extended vertical distribution than the warm gas, requiring either the weight of additional coronal material or magnetic tens...},

abstract = {The final product of galaxy evolution through cosmic time is the population of galaxies in the local universe. These galaxies are also those that can be studied in most detail, thus providing a stringent benchmark for our understanding of galaxy evolution. Through the huge success of spectroscopic single-fiber, statistical surveys of the Local Universe in the last decade, it has become clear, however, that an authoritative observational description of galaxies will involve measuring their spatially resolved properties over their full optical extent for a statistically significant sample. We present here the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction. We summarize the survey goals and design, including sample selection and observational strategy. We also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs (June/July 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemes and general characteristics of the reduced data. This survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of  {\~{}}600 galaxies in the Local Universe (0.005 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.03). CALIFA has been designed to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the following quantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas: distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematic properties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. CALIFA uses the PPAK integral field unit (IFU), with a hexagonal field-of-view of  {\~{}}1.3⎕′, with a 100{\%} covering factor by adopting a three-pointing dithering scheme. The optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000 {\AA}, using two overlapping setups (V500 and V1200), with different resolutions: {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\~{}} 850 and {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\~{}} 1650, respectively. CALIFA is a legacy survey, intended for the community. The reduced data will be released, once the quality has been guaranteed. The analyzed data fulfillthe expectations of the original observing proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratory analysis: (i) the final datacubes reach a 3{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\sigma${\textless}i/{\textgreater} limiting surface brightness depth of  {\~{}}23.0 mag/arcsec{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for the V500 grating data ({\~{}}22.8 mag/arcsec{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for V1200); (ii) about  {\~{}}70{\%} of the covered field-of-view is above this 3{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\sigma${\textless}i/{\textgreater} limit; (iii) the data have a blue-to-red relative flux calibration within a few percent in most of the wavelength range; (iv) the absolute flux calibration is accurate within  {\~{}}8{\%}with respect to SDSS; (v) the measured spectral resolution is  {\~{}}85 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for V1200 ({\~{}}150 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for V500); (vi) the estimated accuracy of the wavelength calibration is  {\~{}}5 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for the V1200 data ({\~{}}10 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for the V500 data); (vii) the aperture matched CALIFA and SDSS spectra are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Finally, we show that we are able to carry out all measurements indicated above, recovering the properties of the stellar populations, the ionized gas andthe kinematics of both components. The associated maps illustrate the spatial variation of these parameters across the field, reemphasizing the redshift dependence of single aperture spectroscopic measurements. We conclude from this first look at the data that CALIFA will be an important resource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the Local Universe.},

abstract = {We perform numerical simulations of the growth of a Population III stellar system under photodissociating feedback. We start from cosmological initial conditions at z = 100, self-consistently following the formation of a minihalo at z = 15 and the subsequent collapse of its central gas to high densities. The simulations resolve scales as small as {\~{}} 1 AU, corresponding to gas densities of 10{\^{}}16 cm{\^{}}-3. Using sink particles to represent the growing protostars, we evolve the stellar system for the next 5000 years. We find that this emerging stellar group accretes at an unusually low rate compared with minihalos which form at earlier times (z = 20 - 30), or with lower baryonic angular momentum. The stars in this unusual system will likely reach masses ranging from {\textless} 1 M{\_}sun to 5 M{\_}sun by the end of their main-sequence lifetimes, placing them in the mass range for which stars will undergo an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Based upon the simulation, we predict the rare existence of Population III stars that have survived to the present day and have been enriched by mass overflow from a previous AGB companion.},

Modern large telescopes discovered galaxies at redshifts greater than seven, whereas theoretical studies have just reached the degree of sophistication necessary to make meaningful predictions. A crucial ingredient is the feedback exerted by the first generation of stars, through UV radiation, supernova blast waves, and chemical enrichment. The key goal is to derive the signature of the first galaxies to be observed with upcoming or planned next-generation facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or Atacama Large Millimeter Array. From the observational side, ongoing deep-field searches for very high-redshift galaxies begin to provide us with empirical constraints on the nature of the first galaxies.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a population of nearby, blue early-type galaxies with high star formation rates (0.5 {\textless} SFR {\textless} 50 Msun/yr). They are identified by their visual morphology as provided by Galaxy Zoo for SDSS DR6 and their u-r colour. We select a volume-limited sample in the redshift range 0.02 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.05, corresponding to luminosities of approximately L* and above, and with u-r colours significantly bluer than the red sequence. We confirm the early-type morphology of the objects in this sample and investigate their environmental dependence and star formation properties. Blue early-type galaxies tend to live in lower-density environments than `normal' red sequence early-types and make up 5.7 +/-0.4{\%} of the low-redshift early-type galaxy population. We find that such blue early-type galaxies are virtually absent at high velocity dispersions above 200 km/s. Our analysis uses emission line diganostic diagrams and we find that {\~{}}25{\%} of them are actively starforming, while another {\~{}}25{\%} host both star formation and an AGN. Another {\~{}}12{\%} are AGN. The remaining 38{\%} show no strong emission lines. When present and uncontaminated by an AGN contribution, the star formation is generally intense. We consider star formation rates derived from Halpha, u-band and infrared luminosities, and radial colour profiles, and conclude that the star formation is spatially extended. Of those objects that are not currently undergoing star formation must have ceased doing so recently in order to account for their blue optical colours. The gas phase metallicity of the actively starforming blue early-types galaxies is supersolar in all cases. We discuss the place of these objects in the context of galaxy formation. A catalogue of all 204 blue early-type galaxies in our sample, including star formation rates and emission line classification, is provided.},

However, the optical and mid-IR spectroscopic properties of PKS1814-637 show more in common with Seyfert galaxies than they do with radio galaxies, with the detection of H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and PAH emission features, along with HI and silicate absorption features, providing evidence for a rich ISM which is likely to be related to the disk morphology of the host galaxy. We argue that the interaction between the radio plasma and the rich ISM in this and similar objects may have boosted their radio emission, allowing them to more easily enter flux limited samples of radio sources. In this case, PKS 1814-637 represents a type of “{\textless}i{\textgreater}imposter{\textless}i/{\textgreater}”: an intrinsically low power object that is selected in a radio flux limited sample because of the unusually efficient conversion of jet power into radio emission. This would make PKS 1814-637 an extreme example of the effects of jet-cloud interactions in galaxies containing a rich ISM, and perhaps a missing link between radio galaxies and radio-loud Seyfert galaxies. However, it is unlikely that jet-cloud interactions alone can account for the unusually powerful radio emission compared to Seyfert galaxies, and it is probable that the jet in PKS 1814-637 is also intrinsically more powerful than in typical Seyfert galaxies, perhaps due to a higher bulge and black hole mass. The estimated BH mass is indeed higher than the majority of Seyfert galaxies in the local Universe. We speculate that sources similar to PKS1814-637 are likely to be more common at high redshifts, because of the enhanced probability at earlier epochs of triggering radio sources in moderately massive bulges that are also gas-rich.},

These galaxies exhibit a relationship between the line strength of Mgb ($\lambda$0 ≈ 5170 {\AA}) and their internal velocity dispersion $\sigma$, similar to local dynamically hot galaxies. For any given $\sigma$, however, the Mgb line strength of the distant ellipticals is significantly lower than the mean value of the nearby sample. The difference in Mgb between the two samples is small ( 〈 $\Delta$Mgb 〉 ≈ − 0.4 {\AA}) and can be fully attributed to the lower age of the distant stellar populations in accordance with the passive evolution model for elliptical galaxies. The low reduction of Mgb at a look-back time of about 5 Gyr requires that the bulk of the stars in cluster ellipticals have formed at very high redshifts of zf {\textgreater} 2. For the most massive galaxies, where the reduction is even lower, zf probably exceeds 4.},

abstract = {Based on Paper I of this series (Mehlert et al. [CITE]), we derive central values and logarithmic gradients for the {\$}{\{}\backslashrm H{\}}\backslashbeta{\$}, Mg and Fe indices of 35 early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster. We find that pure elliptical galaxies have on average slightly higher velocity dispersions, lower {\$}{\{}\backslashrm H{\}}\backslashbeta{\$}, and higher metallic line-strengths than galaxies with disks (S0). The latter form two families, one comparable to the ellipticals and a second one with significantly higher {\$}{\{}\backslashrm H{\}}\backslashbeta{\$}, and weaker metallic lines. Our measured logarithmic gradients within the effective radius are {\$}\backslashlangle\backslashtriangle{\{}\backslashrm Mg{\}}\backslash, b\backslashrangle\backslashapprox -0.037{\$}, {\$}\backslashlangle\backslashtriangle \backslashlangle {\{}\backslashrm Fe{\}}\backslashrangle\backslashrangle\backslashapprox -0.029{\$}, {\$}\backslashlangle\backslashtriangle{\{}\backslashrm H{\}}\backslashbeta\backslashrangle\backslashapprox +0.017{\$} and {\$}\backslashlangle\backslashtriangle\backslashsigma\backslashrangle\backslashapprox -0.063{\$}. The gradients strongly correlate with the gradients of {\textless}i{\textgreater}$\sigma${\textless}i/{\textgreater}, but only weakly with the central index values and galaxy velocity dispersion. Using stellar population models with variable element abundance ratios from Thomas et al. ([CITE]) we derive average ages, metallicities and [ {\$}\backslashalpha/{\{}\backslashrm Fe{\}}{\$}] ratios in the center and at the effective radius. We find that the {\$}\backslashalpha/{\{}\backslashrm Fe{\}}{\$} ratio correlates with velocity dispersion and drives 30{\%} of the Mg–{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\sigma${\textless}i/{\textgreater} relation, the remaining 70{\%} being caused by metallicity variations. We confirm previous findings that part of the lenticular galaxies in the Coma cluster host very young ({\textless}i{\textgreater}∼{\textless}i/{\textgreater}2 Gyr) stellar populations, hence must have experienced relatively recent star formation episodes. Again in accordance with previous work we derive negative metallicity gradients ({\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}} {\{}-{\}}0.16{\$} dex per decade) that are significantly flatter than what is expected from gaseous monolithic collapse models, pointing to the importance of mergers in the galaxy formation history. Moreover, the metallicity gradients correlate with the velocity dispersion gradients, confirming empirically earlier suggestions that the metallicity gradient in ellipticals is produced by the local potential well. The gradients in age are negligible, implying that no significant residual star formation has occurred either in the center or in the outer parts of the galaxies, and that the stellar populations at different radii must have formed at a common epoch. For the first time we derive the gradients of the {\$}\backslashalpha/{\{}\backslashrm Fe{\}}{\$} ratio and find them very small on average. Hence, {\$}\backslashalpha/{\{}\backslashrm Fe{\}}{\$} enhancement is not restricted to galaxy centers but it is a global phenomenon. Our results imply that the Mg–{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\sigma${\textless}i/{\textgreater} local relation inside a galaxy, unlike the global Mg–{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\sigma${\textless}i/{\textgreater} relation, must be primarily driven by metallicity variations alone. Finally we note that none of the stellar population parameters or their gradients depend on the density profile of the Coma cluster, even though it spans 3 dex in density.},

Mg, Hg, and Fe line strengths are analyzed in a sample of elliptical, S0 and brightest cluster galaxies. Radial line strength gradients are measured for 15 galaxies where the spectra extend to approximately the half-light radius (re). Significant results of this study include evidence that line strengths within elliptical galaxies follow a different set of relations from those obeyed by the nuclei of ellipticals; that line strengths at r approximately equal to re in elliptical galaxies are slightly larger than those of metal-rich galactic globulars; and that gradients in early-type galaxies are highly variable, suggesting that they have experienced different star formation histories. Evidence that galaxies with cooling flows have identical Mg and Fe line strengths to galaxies without cooling flows is presented, implying that only a small fraction of the total luminosity of cooling flow galaxies could come from ongoing star formation with a normal stellar initial mass function.},

abstract = {Available data on the magnesium - velocity dispersion (Mg-sigma) relation for $\backslash${\~{}}2000 early-type galaxies is collected and compared. As noted previously, the Mg residuals from a fitted line are roughly Gaussian near the mean but have an asymmetric blue tail, probably from subpopulations of relatively young stars. We define statistics for scatter and asymmetry of scatter in the Mg dimension and find impressive uniformity among data sets. We construct models of galaxy formation built to be as unbiased as possible toward the question of the importance of mergers in the formation of early type galaxies. The observational constraints (Mg-sigma width, asymmetry, and mean Mg strength, plus mean age and width of abundance distribution) are severe enough to eliminate almost all of models. Among the casualties are: models with merger rates proportional to (1+z){\^{}}n with n{\textgreater}0, models that assume early formation followed by recent drizzling of new stars, merger-only models where the number of mergers exceeds {\~{}}80, merger-only models with less than {\~{}}20 mergers, and models with a cold dark matter power spectrum even with biasing included. The most successful models were those with merger probability constant with time, with the number of mergers needed to form the galaxy around 40. These models are characterized by mean light-weighted ages of 7-10 Gyr (consistent with spectroscopic studies), a narrow abundance distribution, and a lookback time behavior nearly indistinguishable from passive evolution of old stellar populations.},

We measure line indices which are defined by the Lick standard system and compare index strengths of the clusters and Galactic bulge. Both metal-rich globular clusters and the bulge are similar in most of the indices, except for the CN index. We find a significant enhancement in the CN/{\textless}Fe{\textgreater} index ratio in metal-rich globular clusters compared with the Galactic bulge. The mean iron index {\textless}Fe{\textgreater} of the two metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 is comparable with the mean iron index of the bulge. Index ratios such as Mgb/{\textless}Fe{\textgreater}, Mg2/{\textless}Fe{\textgreater}, Ca4227/{\textless}Fe{\textgreater}, and TiO/{\textless}Fe{\textgreater}, are comparable in both stellar population indicating similar enhancements in individual elements which are traced by the indices. From the globular cluster data we fully empirically calibrate several metallicity-sensitive indices as a function of [Fe/H] and find tightest correlations for the Mg2 index and the composite [MgFe] index. We find that all indices show a similar behavior with galactocentric radius, except for the Balmer series, which show a large scatter at all radii. However, the scatter is entirely consistent with the cluster-to-cluster variations in the horizontal branch morphology.},

abstract = {We present results of model atmosphere/line formation calculations which quantitatively test how the 21 classical and four higher-order Balmer-line Lick/IDS indices (Worthey et al. 1994, ApJS, 94, 687; Worthey {\&} Ottaviani 1997, ApJS, 111, 377) depend on individual elemental abundances (of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium, silicon, chromium, titanium) and overall metallicity in various stellar evolutionary stages and at various metallicities. At low metallicities the effects of an overall enhancement of {\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater}-elements are also investigated. The general results obtained by Tripicco {\&} Bell (1995, ApJ, 110, 3035) at solar metallicity are confirmed, while details do differ. Tables are given detailing to which element every index reacts significantly, as a function of evolutionary stage and composition. This work validates a number of assumptions implicitly made in the stellar population models of Thomas et al. (2003a, MNRAS, 339, 897), which utilized the results of Tripicco {\&} Bell (1995) to include the effects of element abundance ratios variations. In particular, these computations confirm that fractional changes to index strengths computed at solar metallicity (and solar age) can be applied over a wide range of abundances and ages, also to model old stellar populations with non-solar abundance ratios. The use of metallicity-dependent response functions not only leads to a higher degree of self-consistency in the stellar population models, but is even required for the proper modelling of the Balmer-line indices. We find that the latter become increasingly sensitive to element abundances with increasing metallicity and decreasing wavelength. While H{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\beta${\textless}i/{\textgreater} still responds only moderately to abundance ratio variations, the higher-order Balmer-line indices H{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\gamma${\textless}i/{\textgreater} and H{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\delta${\textless}i/{\textgreater} display very strong dependencies at high metallicities. As shown in Thomas et al. (2004, MNRAS, 351, L19), this result allows to remove systematic effects in age determinations based on different Balmer-line indices.},

We correct some small errors in the radial velocities of the stars, measure the spectral resolution of the library and models more accurately, and give a better absolute flux calibration of the models. (Methods) We use cross-correlation techniques to correct the radial velocities of the offset stars and the penalised pixel-fitting method, together with different sets of stellar templates, to re-assess the spectral resolution of the MILES stellar library and models. We have also re-calibrated the zero-point flux level of the models using a new calibration scheme. (Results) The end result is an even more homogeneously calibrated stellar library than the originally released one, with a measured spectral resolution of {\~{}}2.5$\backslash$AA, almost constant with wavelength, for both the MILES stellar library and models. Furthermore, the new absolute flux calibration for the spectra excellently agrees with predictions based on independent photometric libraries. (Conclusions) This improved version of the MILES library and models (version 9.1) is available at the project's website (http://miles.iac.es).},

abstract = {Stellar population models of absorption line indices are an important tool for the analysis of stellar population spectra. They are most accurately modelled through empirical calibrations of absorption line indices with the stellar parameters effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity, the so-called fitting functions. Here we present new empirical fitting functions for the 25 optical Lick absorption line indices based on the new stellar library MILES. The major improvements with respect to the Lick/IDS library are the better sampling of stellar parameter space, a generally higher signal- to-noise, and a careful flux calibration. In fact we find that errors on individual index measurements in MILES are considerably smaller than in Lick/IDS. Instead we find the rms of the residuals between the final fitting functions and the data to be dominated by errors in the stellar parameters. We provide fitting functions for both Lick/IDS and MILES spectral resolutions, and compare our results with other fitting functions in the literature. A Fortran 90 code is available online in order to simplify the implementation in stellar population models. We further calculate the offsets in index measurements between the Lick/IDS system to a flux calibrated system. For this purpose we use the three libraries MILES, ELODIE, and STELIB. We find that offsets are negligible in some cases, most notably for the widely used indices Hbeta, Mgb, Fe5270, and Fe5335. In a number of cases, however, the difference between flux calibrated library and Lick/IDS is significant with the offsets depending on index strengths. Interestingly, there is no general agreement between the three libraries for a large number of indices, which hampers the derivation of a universal offset between the Lick/IDS and flux calibrated systems.},

abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) provides the link between the stellar and dust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. In the present work we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual {\&} Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05) and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: 1) The FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age-dependence is incorrect; 2) All models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J-K and V-K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; 4) All models predict ugr colors too red, D4000 strengths too strong and Hdelta strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; 5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D4000, and Hdelta strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main sequence turn-off). We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.

The modular structure of the code allows to easily assess the impact on the synthetic spectral energy distribution of the various assumptions and model ingredients, such as, for example, uncertainties in stellar evolutionary models, mixing length, the temperature distribution of horizontal branch (HB) stars, AGB mass loss, and colour-temperature transformations. The so-called ``AGB-Phase Transition'' in Magellanic Cloud clusters is used to calibrate the contribution of the Thermally Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch phase (TP-AGB) to the synthetic integrated luminosity. As an illustrative example, solar metallicity ({\$}Y=0.27,Z=0.02{\$}) models, with ages ranging between 30 {\{}$\backslash$rm Myr{\}} and 15 {\{}$\backslash$rm Gyr{\}} and various choices for the slope of the Initial Mass Function (IMF), are presented. Synthetic broad band colours and the luminosity contributions of the various evolutionary stages are compared with LMC and Galactic globular cluster data. In all these cases, a good agreement is found. Finally, we show the evolution of stellar mass-to-light ratios in the bolometric and U,B,V,R, and K passbands, in which the contribution of stellar remnants is accounted for.},

For each galaxy, we obtain high-quality spectra in the wavelength range of 3650 to 5850 A from the 246-fiber Mitchell integral-field spectrograph (IFS) at McDonald Observatory, covering a 107" x 107" field of view (often reaching 2 to 3 effective radii). We measure the 2-D spatial distribution of each galaxy's angular momentum (lambda and fast or slow rotator status), velocity dispersion (sigma), and higher-order non-Gaussian velocity features (Gauss-Hermite moments h3 to h6). Our sample contains a high fraction ({\~{}}80{\%} ) of slow and non-rotators with lambda {\textless}{\~{}} 0.2.

All of our fast rotators show a clear anti-correlation between h3 and V/sigma, and the slope of the anti-correlation is steeper in more round galaxies. The radial profiles of sigma show a clear luminosity and environmental dependence: the 12 most luminous galaxies in our sample (MK {\textless}{\~{}} -26 mag) are all brightest cluster/group galaxies (except NGC 4874) and all have rising or nearly flat sigma profiles, whereas five of the seven "isolated" galaxies are all fainter than MK = -25.8 mag and have falling sigma. All of our galaxies have positive average h4; the most luminous galaxies have average h4 {\~{}} 0.05 while less luminous galaxies have a range of values between 0 and 0.05. Most of our galaxies show positive radial gradients in h4, and those galaxies also tend to have rising sigma profiles. We discuss the implications for the relationship among dynamical mass, sigma, h4, and velocity anisotropy for these massive galaxies.},

abstract = {We point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation in early-type galaxies. It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ) using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique. We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an early-type galaxy red and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star-forming clumps. While gas stripping processes are limited to dense groups and clusters, and other quenching mechanisms like AGN feedback, virial shock heating and gravitational heating, are limited to halos more massive than 10{\^{}}12 Mo, the MQ can explain the appearance of red ellipticals even in less massive halos and in the field. The dense gas disks observed in some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks are expected to be more frequent at high redshift.},

Their individual CO emission exhibits a double-horned line profile that is characteristic of an inclined rotating disk with a central depression at the rising part of its rotation curve. The inferred disk or ring distributions of the molecular gas are consistent with the observed presence of dust disks or rings detected optically in the cores of both galaxies. For a CO-to-H2 conversion factor similar to that of our Galaxy, the corresponding total mass in molecular hydrogen gas is (1.3+/-0.2)×109 Msolar in 3C 31 and (0.31+/-0.06)×109 Msolar in 3C 264. Despite their relatively large molecular gas masses and other peculiarities, both 3C 31 and 3C 264, as well as many other powerful radio galaxies in the (revised) 3C catalog, are known to lie within the fundamental plane of normal elliptical galaxies. We reason that if their gas originates from the mergers of two gas-rich disk galaxies, as has been invoked to explain the molecular gas in other radio galaxies, then both 3C 31 and 3C 264 must have merged a long time (a few billion years or more) ago, but their remnant elliptical galaxies have only recently (last tens of millions of years or less) become active in radio. Instead, we argue that the cannibalism of gas-rich galaxies provides a simpler explanation for the origin of molecular gas in the elliptical hosts of radio galaxies. Given the transient nature of their observed disturbances, these galaxies probably become active in radio soon after the accretion event, when sufficient molecular gas agglomerates in their nuclei.},

This terminates star formation in the galaxy and stifles accretion onto the black hole. Such active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can account for the observed proportionality between the central black hole and the host galaxy mass. Direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback, which occurs when AGN are very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is accumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio mode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when AGN are operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical galaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot surrounding medium.

The depletion of gas resulting from quasar-driven outflows should eventually stop star-formation in the host galaxy and lead the black hole to "suicide" for starvation. Direct observational evidence for a major quasar feedback onto the host galaxy is still missing, since outflows previously observed in quasars are generally associated with the ionized component of the gas, which only accounts for a minor fraction of the total gas content, and typically occurring in the central regions. We used the IRAM PdB Interferometer to observe CO(1-0) in Mrk 231, the closest QSO known. Thanks to the wide band we detect broad wings of the CO line, with velocities up to 750 km/s and spatially resolved on the kpc scale. Such broad CO wings trace a giant molecular outflow of about 700 MSun/yr, far larger than the ongoing star-formation rate ({\~{}}200 MSun/yr) observed in the host galaxy. This wind will totally expel the cold gas reservoir in Mrk 231 in about 1e7 yrs, therefore halting the star-formation activity on the same timescale. The inferred kinetic energy in the molecular outflow is {\~{}}1.2e44 erg/s, corresponding to a few percent of the AGN bolometric luminosity, very close to the fraction expected by models ascribing quasar feedback to highly supersonic shocks generated by radiatively accelerated nuclear winds. The direct observational evidence for quasar feedback reported here provides solid support to the scenarios ascribing the observed properties of local massive galaxies to quasar-induced large scale winds.},

abstract = {In this first paper on the results of our Herschel PACS survey of local Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), as part of our SHINING survey of local galaxies, we present far-infrared spectroscopy of Mrk 231, the most luminous of the local ULIRGs, and a type 1 broad absorption line AGN. For the first time in a ULIRG, all observed far-infrared fine-structure lines in the PACS range were detected and all were found to be deficient relative to the far infrared luminosity by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude compared with lower luminosity galaxies. The deficits are similar to those for the mid-infrared lines, with the most deficient lines showing high ionization potentials. Aged starbursts may account for part of the deficits, but partial covering of the highest excitation AGN powered regions may explain the remaining line deficits. A massive molecular outflow, discovered in OH and 18OH, showing outflow velocities out to at least 1400 km/sec, is a unique signature of the clearing out of the molecular disk that formed by dissipative collapse during the merger. The outflow is characterized by extremely high ratios of 18O / 16O suggestive of interstellar medium processing by advanced starbursts.},

abstract = {The quasi-stellar object (QSO)/merger Mrk 231 is arguably the nearest and best laboratory for studying QSO feedback. It hosts several outflows, including broad-line winds, radio jets, and a poorly-understood kpc scale outflow. In this Letter, we present integral field spectroscopy from the Gemini telescope that represents the first unambiguous detection of a wide-angle, kpc scale outflow from a powerful QSO. Using neutral gas absorption, we show that the nuclear region hosts an outflow with blueshifted velocities reaching 1100 km/s, extending 2-3 kpc from the nucleus in all directions in the plane of the sky. A radio jet impacts the outflow north of the nucleus, accelerating it to even higher velocities (up to 1400 km/s). Finally, 3.5 kpc south of the nucleus, star formation is simultaneously powering an outflow that reaches more modest velocities of only 570 km/s. Blueshifted ionized gas is also detected around the nucleus at lower velocities and smaller scales. The mass and energy flux from the outflow are {\textgreater}{\~{}}2.5 times the star formation rate and {\textgreater}{\~{}}0.7{\%} of the active galactic nucleus luminosity, consistent with negative feedback models of QSOs.},

abstract = {We compare the average star formation (SF) activity in X-ray selected AGN hosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming and quiescent sources, at 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5. Recent observations carried out by PACS, the 60-210um Herschel photometric camera, in GOODS-S, GOODS-N and COSMOS allow us to unbiasedly estimate the far-IR luminosity, and hence the SF properties, of the two samples. Accurate AGN host stellar masses are measured by decomposing their total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. We find a higher average SF activity in AGN hosts with respect to non-AGNs. The level of SF enhancement is modest ({\~{}}0.26dex at {\~{}}3sigma) at low X-ray luminosities (Lx{\textless}{\~{}}10{\^{}}43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at {\textgreater}10sigma) for bright AGNs. However, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, AGN hosts are broadly consistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. We investigate the relative far-IR luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find a higher fraction of PACS detected, hence normal and highly star forming systems among AGN hosts. Although different interpretations are possible, we explain our findings as a consequence of a twofold AGN growth path: faint AGNs evolve through secular processes, with instantaneous AGN accretion not tightly linked to the current total SF in the host, while luminous AGNs co-evolve with their hosts through periods of enhanced AGN activity and SF, possibly through major mergers. While an increased SF with respect to non-AGNs of similar mass is expected in the latter, we interpret the modest SF offsets measured in low-Lx AGN hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and SF histories in a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous SF and accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger) mechanisms. Far-IR luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.},

abstract = {The old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massive black holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history when galaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (AGN) shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. It is widely suspected, but unproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellar components results from the AGN quenching the surrounding star formation as it approaches its peak luminosity. X-rays trace emission from AGN unambiguously, while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and are brightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. Here we report observations in the submillimetre and X-ray which show that rapid star formation was common in the host galaxies of AGN when the Universe was 2-6 Gyrs old, but that the most vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an X-ray luminosity of 10{\^{}}44 erg/s. This suppression of star formation in the host galaxies of powerful AGN is a key prediction of models in which the AGN drives a powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy and transforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.},

abstract = {The mass density of massive black holes observed locally is consistent with the hard X-ray Background provided that most of the radiation produced during their growth was absorbed by surrounding gas. A simple model is proposed here for the formation of galaxy bulges and central black holes in which young spheroidal galaxies have a significant distributed component of cold dusty clouds which accounts for the absorption. The central accreting black hole is assumed to emit both a quasar-like spectrum, which is absorbed by the surrounding gas, and a slow wind. The power in both is less than the Eddington limit for the black hole. The wind however exerts the most force on the gas and, as earlier suggested by Silk {\&} Rees, when the black hole reaches a critical mass, it is powerful enough to eject the cold gas from the galaxy, so terminating the growth of both black hole and galaxy. In the present model this point occurs when the Thomson depth in the surrounding gas has dropped to about unity and results in the mass of the black hole being proportional to the mass of the spheroid, with the normalization agreeing with that found for local galaxies by Magorrian et al. for reasonable wind parameters. The model predicts a new population of hard X-ray and sub-mm sources at redshifts above one which are powered by black holes in their main growth phase.},

abstract = {Stellar bars can lead to gas inflow toward the center of a galaxy and stimulate nuclear star formation. However, there is no compelling evidence on whether they also feed a central supermassive black hole: by measuring the fractions of barred active and inactive galaxies, previous studies have yielded conflicting results. In this paper, we aim to understand the lack of observational evidence for bar-driven active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity by studying a sample of 41 nearby (d {\textless} 35 Mpc) barred galaxies from the Spitzer Survey for Stellar Structure in Galaxies. We use Chandra observations to measure nuclear 2--10 keV X-ray luminosities and estimate Eddington ratios, together with Spitzer 3.6um imaging to quantify the strength of the stellar bar in two independent ways: (1) from its structure, as traced by its ellipticity and boxiness, and (2) from its gravitational torque Q{\_}b, taken as the maximum ratio of the tangential force to the mean background radial force. In this way, rather than discretizing the presence of both stellar bars and nuclear activity, we are able to account for the continuum of bar strengths and degrees of AGN activity. We find nuclear X-ray sources in 31 out of 41 galaxies with median X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio of L{\_}X=4.3x10{\^{}}{\{}38{\}} erg/s and L{\_}bol/L{\_}Edd=6.9x10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}} respectively, consistent with low-luminosity AGN activity. Including upper limits for those galaxies without nuclear detections, we find no significant correlation between any of the bar strength indicators and the degree of nuclear activity, irrespective of galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, Hubble type, or bulge size. Strong bars do not favor brighter or more efficient nuclear activity, implying that at least for the low-luminosity regime, supermassive black hole fueling is not closely connected to large scale features.},

abstract = {We analyze the observed distribution of Eddington ratios as a function of supermassive black hole mass for a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We demonstrate that there are two distinct regimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. The first is associated with galaxies with significant star formation in their central kiloparsec regions, and is characterized by a broad log-normal distribution of accretion rates peaked at about one percent of the Eddington limit. In this regime, the Eddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole and shows no further dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy. The second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellar populations, and is characterized by a power-law distribution function of Eddington ratios. In this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate onto black holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars. This result is once again independent of black hole mass. We show that both the slope of the power-law and the decrease in the accretion rate onto black holes in old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions of the decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. Our results lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the local Universe. If the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the black hole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on the properties of the interstellar medium. Once the gas runs out, black hole growth is regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.},

We find that most present-day accretion occurs onto black holes with masses {\textless} 10E8 Msun that reside in moderately massive galaxies (M {\~{}} 10E10 to 10E11.5 Msun) with high stellar densities ({\~{}}10E8.5 to 10E9.5 Msun/kpc{\^{}}2) and young stellar populations. The volume-averaged accretion rates of low mass black holes ({\textless}10E7.5 Msun) imply that this population is growing on a timescale that is comparable to the age of the Universe. Around half this growth takes place in AGN that are radiating within a factor of five of the Eddington luminosity. Such systems are rare, making up only 0.2{\%} of the low mass black hole population at the present day. The rest of the growth occurs in lower luminosity AGN. The growth timescale is more than two orders of magnitude longer for the population of the most massive black holes in our sample. The volume averaged ratio of star formation to black hole accretion in bulge-dominated galaxies is {\~{}}1000, in remarkable agreement with the observed ratio of stellar mass to black hole mass in nearby galaxy bulges. We conclude: a) that bulge formation and black hole formation are tightly coupled, even in present-day galaxies; and b) that the evolution of the AGN luminosity function documented in recent optical and x-ray surveys is driven by a decrease in the characteristic mass scale of accreting black holes.},

abstract = {We have performed 2D bulge/bar/disc decompositions using g, r and i-band images of a representative sample of nearly 1000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that the Petrosian concentration index is a better proxy for bulge-to-total ratio than the global Sersic index. We show that pseudo-bulges can be distinguished from classical bulges as outliers in the Kormendy relation. We provide the structural parameters and distributions of stellar masses of ellipticals, classical bulges, pseudo-bulges, discs and bars, and find that 32 per cent of the total stellar mass in massive galaxies in the local universe is contained in ellipticals, 36 per cent in discs, 25 per cent in classical bulges, 3 per cent in pseudo-bulges and 4 per cent in bars. Pseudo-bulges are currently undergoing intense star formation activity and populate the blue cloud of the colour-magnitude diagram. Most (though not all) classical bulges are quiescent and populate the red sequence of the diagram. Classical bulges follow a correlation between bulge Sersic index and bulge-to-total ratio, while pseudo-bulges do not. In addition, for a fixed bulge-to-total ratio, pseudo-bulges are less concentrated than classical bulges. Pseudo-bulges follow a mass-size relation similar to that followed by bars, and different from that followed by classical bulges. In the fundamental plane, pseudo-bulges occupy the same locus as discs. While these results point out different formation processes for classical and pseudo-bulges, we also find a significant overlap in their properties, indicating that the different processes might happen concomitantly. Finally, classical bulges and ellipticals follow offset mass-size relations, suggesting that high-mass bulges might not be simply high-mass ellipticals surrounded by discs.},

abstract = {We review internal processes of secular evolution in galaxy disks, concentrating on the buildup of dense central features that look like classical, merger-built bulges but that were made slowly out of disk gas. We call these pseudobulges. As an existence proof, we review how bars rearrange disk gas into outer rings, inner rings, and gas dumped into the center. In simulations, this gas reaches high densities that plausibly feed star formation. In the observations, many SB and oval galaxies show central concentrations of gas and star formation. Star formation rates imply plausible pseudobulge growth times of a few billion years. If secular processes built dense central components that masquerade as bulges, can we distinguish them from merger-built bulges? Observations show that pseudobulges retain a memory of their disky origin. They have one or more characteristics of disks: (1) flatter shapes than those of classical bulges, (2) large ratios of ordered to random velocities indicative of disk dynamics, (3) small velocity dispersions, (4) spiral structure or nuclear bars in the bulge part of the light profile, (5) nearly exponential brightness profiles, and (6) starbursts. These structures occur preferentially in barred and oval galaxies in which secular evolution should be rapid. So the cleanest examples of pseudobulges are recognizable. Thus a large variety of observational and theoretical results contribute to a new picture of galaxy evolution that complements hierarchical clustering and merging.},

abstract = {Self-gravitating systems evolve toward the most tightly bound configuration that is reachable via available evolution processes. The inner parts shrink and the outer parts expand, provided that some physical process transports energy or angular momentum outward. The evolution of stars, star clusters, protostellar and protoplanetary disks, black hole accretion disks, and galaxy disks are all fundamentally similar. These processes for galaxy disks are the subjects of my lectures and of this Canary Islands Winter School. Part 1 discusses formation, growth, and death of bars. Part 2 details the slow ("secular") rearrangement of angular momentum that results from interactions between stars or gas and nonaxisymmetries such as bars. We have a heuristic understanding of how this forms outer rings, inner rings, and stuff dumped into the center. Observations show that barred galaxies have central concentrations of gas and star formation. Timescales imply that they grow central "pseudobulges" that get mistaken for elliptical-galaxy-like classical bulges but that formed gently out of disks. Part 3 shows how we distinguish between classical and pseudo bulges. Part 4 reviews how environmental secular evolution transforms gas-rich, star-forming spirals and irregulars into gas-poor, red and dead S0 and spheroidal ("Sph") galaxies. Sphs are not ellipticals; they have structural parameters like those of low-luminosity S+Im galaxies. So Sphs are bulgeless S0s. Part 5 combines hierarchical clustering and secular evolution into a comprehensive picture.},

abstract = {The growth of supermassive black holes appears to be driven by galaxy mergers, violent merger-free processes and/or `secular' processes. In order to quantify the effects of secular evolution on black hole growth, we study a sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies with a calm formation history free of significant mergers, a population that heretofore has been difficult to locate. Here we present an initial sample of 13 AGN in massive (M{\_}* {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1e10 M{\_}sun) bulgeless galaxies -- which lack the classical bulges believed inevitably to result from mergers -- selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using visual classifications from Galaxy Zoo. Parametric morphological fitting confirms the host galaxies lack classical bulges; any contributions from pseudobulges are very small (typically {\textless} 5{\%}). We compute black hole masses for the two broad-line objects in the sample (4.2e6 and 1.2e7 M{\_}sun) and place lower limits on black hole masses for the remaining sample (typically M{\_}BH {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1e6 M{\_}sun), showing that significant black hole growth must be possible in the absence of mergers or violent disk instabilities. The black hole masses are systematically higher than expected from established bulge-black hole relations. However, if the mean Eddington ratio of the systems with measured black hole masses (L/L{\_}Edd = 0.065) is typical, 10 of 13 sources are consistent with the correlation between black hole mass and total stellar mass. That pure disk galaxies and their central black holes may be consistent with a relation derived from elliptical and bulge-dominated galaxies with very different formation histories implies the details of stellar galaxy evolution and dynamics may not be fundamental to the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes.},

abstract = {We have conducted a high-resolution spectroscopic study using Spitzer of 18 bulgeless (Sd/Sdm) galaxies that show no definitive signatures of nuclear activity in their optical spectra. This is the first systematic mid-IR search for weak or hidden AGNs in a statistically significant sample of bulgeless disk galaxies. Based on the detection of the high-ionization [NeV] line, we report the discovery of an AGN in one out of the 18 galaxies in the sample. This galaxy, NGC 4178, is a nearby edge-on Sd galaxy, which likely hosts a prominent nuclear star cluster (NSC). The bolometric luminosity of the AGN inferred from the [NeV] luminosity is {\~{}} 8e41 ergs/s. This is almost two orders of magnitude greater than the luminosity of the AGN in NGC 4395, the best studied AGN in a bulgeless disk galaxy. Assuming that the AGN in NGC 4178 is radiating below the Eddington limit, the lower mass limit for the black hole is {\~{}} 6e3M{\_}sun. The fact that none of the other galaxies in the sample shows any evidence for an AGN demonstrates that while the AGN detection rate based on mid-IR diagnostics is high (30-40{\%}) in optically quiescent galaxies with pseudobulges, it drops drastically in Sd/Sdm galaxies. Our observations therefore confirm that AGNs in completely bulgeless disk galaxies are not hidden in the optical but truly are rare. Of the three Sd galaxies with AGNs known so far, all have prominent NSCs, suggesting that in the absence of a well-defined bulge, the galaxy must possess a NSC in order to host an AGN. While the presence of a NSC appears to be a requirement for hosting an AGN in bulgeless galaxies, neither the properties of the NSC nor those of the host galaxy appear exceptional in late-type AGN hosts. The recipe for forming and growing a central black hole in a bulgeless galaxy therefore remains unknown.},

abstract = {AGN feedback now appears as an attractive mechanism to resolve some of the outstanding problems with the "standard" cosmological models, in particular those related to massive galaxies. To directly constrain how this may influence the formation of massive galaxies near the peak in the redshift distribution of powerful quasars, z{\~{}}2, we present an analysis of the emission-line kinematics of 3 powerful radio galaxies at z{\~{}}2-3 (HzRGs) based on rest-frame optical integral-field spectroscopy obtained with SINFONI on the VLT. HzRGs are among the most massive galaxies, so AGN feedback may have a particularly clear signature. We find evidence for bipolar outflows in all HzRGs, with kinetic energies that are equivalent to 0.2{\%} of the rest-mass of the supermassive black hole. Velocity offsets in the outflows are {\~{}}800-1000 km s{\^{}}-1 between the blueshifted and redshifted line emission, FWHMs {\~{}}1000 km s{\^{}}-1 suggest strong turbulence. Ionized gas masses estimated from the Ha luminosity are of order 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}s, similar to the molecular gas content of HzRGs, underlining that these outflows may indicate a significant phase in the evolution of the host galaxy. The total energy release of {\~{}}10{\^{}}60 erg during a dynamical time of {\~{}}10{\^{}}7 yrs corresponds to about the binding energy of a massive galaxy. Geometry, timescales and energy injection rates of order 10{\%} of the kinetic energy flux of the jet suggest that the outflows are most likely driven by the radio source. The global energy density release of {\~{}}10{\^{}}57 erg s{\^{}}-1 Mpc{\^{}}-3 may also influence the subsequent evolution of the HzRG by enhancing the entropy and pressure in the surrounding halo and facilitating ram-pressure stripping of gas in satellite galaxies that may contribute to the subsequent mass assembly of the HzRG through low-dissipation "dry" mergers.},

We have observed the [CII]158um transition in SDSSJ114816.64+525150.3 that, at z=6.4189, is one of the most distant quasars known. We detect broad wings of the line tracing a quasar-driven massive outflow. This is the most distant massive outflow ever detected and is likely tracing the long sought quasar feedback, already at work in the early Universe. The outflow is marginally resolved on scales of about 16 kpc, implying that the outflow can really affect the whole galaxy, as required by quasar feedback models. The inferred outflow rate, dM/dt {\textgreater} 3500 Msun/yr, is the highest ever found. At this rate the outflow can clean the gas in the host galaxy, and therefore quench star formation, in a few million years.},

However, inverse Compton losses against the intense microwave background substantially reduce the ages and numbers of sources that are detected in flux-limited surveys. The realization that the galaxy forming material in those epochs was concentrated in filaments occupying a small fraction of the total volume then leads to the conclusion that radio lobes permeated much of the volume occupied by the protogalactic material during that era. The sustained overpressure in these extended lobes is likely to have played an important role in triggering the high inferred rate of galaxy formation at z {\textgreater} 1.5 and in the magnetization of the cosmic network of filaments.},

abstract = {We selected 27244 nearby, red, giant early-type galaxies (RGEs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In a large fraction (53{\%}) of their spectra the [O III] emission line is detected, with an equivalent width (EW) distribution strongly clustered around {\~{}}0.75 A. The vast majority of those RGEs for which it is possible to derive emission line ratios (amounting to about half of the sample) show values characteristic of LINERs. The close connection between emission lines and stellar continuum points to stellar processes as the most likely source of the bulk of the ionizing photons in RGEs, rather than active nuclei. In particular, the observed EW and optical line ratios are consistent with the predictions of models in which the photoionization comes from to hot evolved stars. Shocks driven by supernovae or stellar ejecta might also contribute to the ionization budget. A minority, {\~{}}4{\%}, of the galaxies show emission lines with an equivalent that is width a factor of {\~{}}2 greater than the sample median. Only among them are Seyfert-like spectra found. Furthermore, 40{\%} of this subgroup have a radio counterpart, compared to {\~{}}6{\%} of the rest of the sample. These characteristics argue in favor of an AGN origin for their emission lines. Emission lines diagnostic diagrams do not reveal a distinction between the AGN subset and the other members of the sample, and consequently they are not a useful tool for establishing the dominant source of the ionizing photons, which is better predicted by the EW of the emission lines.},

abstract = {Using numerical simulations, we modeled the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic behavior of a plasma flowing into a rapidly rotating black hole in a large-scale magnetic field. The results show that a torsional Alfv{\'{e}}n wave is generated by the rotational dragging of space near the black hole. The wave transports energy along the magnetic field lines outward, causing the total energy of the plasma near the hole to decrease to negative values. When this negative energy plasma enters the horizon, the rotational energy of the black hole decreases. Through this process, the energy of the spinning black hole is extracted magnetically},

abstract = {The properties of the host galaxies of a well-defined sample of 2215 radio-loud AGN with redshifts 0.03 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.3, defined from the SDSS, are investigated. These are predominantly low radio luminosity sources, with 1.4GHz luminosities of 10{\^{}}23 to 10{\^{}}25 W/Hz. The fraction of galaxies that host radio-loud AGN with L(1.4GHz) {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}23 W/Hz is a strong function of stellar mass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 10{\^{}}10 Msun to more than 30{\%} at 5x10{\^{}}11 Msun. The integral radio luminosity function is derived in six ranges of stellar and black hole mass. Its shape is very similar in all of these ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power-law. Its normalisation varies strongly with mass, as M{\_}*{\^{}}2.5 or M{\_}BH{\^{}}1.6; this scaling only begins to break down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30{\%}. There is no correlation between radio and emission line luminosities for the radio-loud AGN in the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio-loud is independent of whether it is optically classified as an AGN. The host galaxies of the radio-loud AGN have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies of the same mass. All of these findings support the conclusion that the optical AGN and low radio luminosity AGN phenomena are independent and are triggered by different physical mechanisms. Intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of the radio-loud AGN fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from the hot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. It is speculated that gas cooling provides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud AGN activity, and it is argued that AGN heating could plausibly balance the cooling of the gas over time.

abstract = {Most hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster formation carried out to date have tried to model the cosmic gas as an ideal, inviscid fluid, where only a small amount of (unwanted) numerical viscosity is present, arising from practical limitations of the numerical method employed, and with a strength that depends on numerical resolution. However, the physical viscosity of the gas in hot galaxy clusters may in fact not be negligible, suggesting that a self-consistent treatment that accounts for the internal gas friction would be more appropriate. To allow such simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, we derive a novel SPH formulation of the Navier-Stokes and general heat transfer equations and implement them in the GADGET-2 code. We include both shear and bulk viscosity stress tensors, as well as saturation criteria that limit viscous stress transport where appropriate. Adopting Braginskii's parameterization for the shear viscosity of hot gaseous plasmas, we then study the influence of viscosity on the interplay between AGN-inflated bubbles and the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We find that certain bubble properties like morphology, maximum clustercentric radius reached, or survival time depend quite sensitively on the assumed level of viscosity. Interestingly, the sound waves launched into the ICM by the bubble injection are damped by physical viscosity, establishing a non-local heating process. Finally, we carry out cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation with a viscous intracluster medium. Viscosity modifies the dynamics of mergers and the motion of substructures through the cluster atmosphere. Substructures are generally more efficiently stripped of their gas, leading to prominent long gaseous tails behind infalling massive halos. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We simulate the effects of viscous dissipation of waves that are generated by AGN activity in clusters of galaxies. We demonstrate that the amount of viscous heating associated with the dissipation of these waves can offset radiative cooling rates in cooling flow clusters of galaxies. This heating mechanism leads to spatially distributed and approximately symmetrical dissipation. The heating waves reach a given distance from the cluster center on a timescale shorter than the cooling time. This means that this heating mechanism has the potential of quenching cooling flows in a quasi-stable fashion. Moreover, the heating is gentle as no strong shocks are present in the simulations. We first investigated whether a single continuous episode of AGN activity can lead to adequate dissipation to balance cooling rates. These simulations demonstrated that, whereas secondary waves generated by the interaction of the rising bubble with the intracluster medium are clearly present, viscous heating associated with the dissipation of these waves is insufficient to balance radiative cooling. It is only when the central source is intermittent that the viscous dissipation of waves associated with subsequent episodes of activity can offset cooling. This suggests that the ripples observed in the Perseus cluster can be interpreted as being due to the AGN duty cycle, i.e., they trace AGN activity history. The simulations were performed using the PPM adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH in two dimensions.},

If, as has been conjectured for the Perseus cluster, these are sound waves generated by the repetitive inflation of central radio bubbles, they represent around 5x10{\^{}}42 erg/s of spherical sound-wave power at a radius of 30 kpc. The period of the waves would be 10{\^{}}7 yr.

abstract = {We present the first results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I observation of M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect filamentary structures associated with the eastern and southwestern X-ray and radio arms. Many filaments are spatially resolved with widths of {\~{}}300 pc. This filamentary structure is particularly striking in the eastern arm where we suggest the filaments are outer edges of a series of plasma-filled, buoyant bubbles whose ages differ by {\~{}}6 x 10{\^{}}6 years. These X-ray structures may be influenced by magnetic filamentation. At hard energies (3.5-7.5 keV), we detect a nearly circular ring of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc) which provides an unambiguous signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH. The density rise in the shock is {\~{}}1.3 (Mach number, M{\~{}}1.2). The observed spectral hardening in the ring corresponds to a temperature rise T{\_}shock / T{\_}0 {\~{}} 1.2, or M{\~{}}1.2, in agreement with the Mach number derived independently from the gas density. Thus, for the first time, we detect gas temperature and density jumps associated with a classical shock in the atmosphere around a supermassive black hole. We also detect two additional surface brightness edges and pressure enhancements at radii of {\~{}}0.6' and {\~{}}1'. The {\~{}}0.6' feature may be over-pressurized thermal gas surrounding the relativistic plasma in the radio cocoon, the ``piston'', produced by the current episode of AGN activity. The over-pressurized gas is surrounded by a cool gas shell. The {\~{}}1' feature may be an additional weak shock from a secondary outburst. In an earlier episode, the ``piston'' was responsible for driving the 2.8' shock.},

abstract = {We present the first results from a very deep Chandra X-ray observation of the core of the Perseus cluster of galaxies. A pressure map reveals a clear thick band of high pressure around the inner radio bubbles. The gas in the band must be expanding outward and the sharp front to it is identified as a shock front, yet we see no temperature jump across it; indeed there is more soft emission behind the shock than in front of it. We conclude that in this inner region either thermal conduction operates efficiently or the co-existing relativistic plasma seen as the radio mini-halo is mediating the shock. If common, isothermal shocks in cluster cores mean that we cannot diagnose the expansion speed of radio bubbles from temperature measurements alone. They can at times expand more rapidly than currently assumed without producing significant regions of hot gas. Bubbles may also be significantly more energetic. The pressure ripples found in earlier images are identified as isothermal sound waves. A simple estimate based on their amplitude confirms that they can be an effective distributed heat source able to balance radiative cooling. We see multiphase gas with about 10{\^{}}9 Msun at a temperature of about 0.5 keV. Much, but not all, of this cooler gas is spatially associated with the optical filamentary nebula around the central galaxy, NGC 1275. A residual cooling flow of about 50 Msun/yr may be taking place. A channel is found in the pressure map along the path of the bubbles, with indications found of outer bubbles. The channel connects in the S with a curious cold front.},

A clear density jump at a radius of 24 kpc to the NE, about 10 kpc out from the bubble rim, appears to be due to a weak shock driven by the northern radio bubble. A similar front may exist round both inner bubbles but is masked elsewhere by rim emission from bright cooler gas. The continuous blowing of bubbles by the central radio source, leading to the propagation of weak shocks and viscously-dissipating sound waves seen as the observed fronts and ripples, gives a rate of working which balances the radiative cooling within the inner 50 kpc of the cluster core.},

abstract = {In the Big Bang about 5{\%} of the mass that was created was in the form of normal baryonic matter (neutrons and protons). Of this about 10{\%} ended up in galaxies in the form of stars or of gas (that can be in molecules, can be atomic, or can be ionized). In this work, we measure the baryonic mass function of galaxies, which describes how the baryonic mass is distributed within galaxies of different types (e.g. spiral or elliptical) and of different sizes. This can provide useful constraints on our current cosmology, convolved with our understanding of how galaxies form. This work relies on various large astronomical surveys, e.g. the optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (to observe stars) and the HIPASS radio survey (to observe atomic gas). We then perform an integral over our mass function to determine the cosmological density of baryons in galaxies: Omega(b,gal)=0.0035. Most of these baryons are in stars: Omega(*)=0.0028. Only about 20{\%} are in gas. The error on the quantities, as determined from the range obtained between different methods, is ca 10{\%}; systematic errors may be much larger. Most (ca 90{\%}) of the baryons in the Universe are not in galaxies. They probably exist in a warm/hot intergalactic medium. Searching for direct observational evidence and deeper theoretical understanding for this will form one of the major challenges for astronomy in the next decade.},

In the absence of strong surface tension, initially spherical bubbles will transform into tori as they rise through an external medium. Such structures can be identified in the radio images of the halo of M87. During their rise, bubbles will uplift relatively cool X-ray emitting gas from the central regions of the cooling flow to larger distances. This gas is colder than the ambient gas and has a higher volume emissivity. As a result, rising ``radio'' bubbles may be trailed by elongated X-ray features as indeed is observed in M87.

Overall evolution of the bubble may resemble the evolution of a hot bubble during a powerful atmospheric explosion. From a comparison of the time scale of the bubble inflation to the rise time of the bubbles and from the observed size of the radio lobes which displace the thermal gas, the energy release in the relativistic plasma by the active nucleus of NGC 1275 can be inferred. Approximate modeling implies a nuclear power output of the order of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}45{\}}{\$} erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} averaged over the last {\$}\backslashsim 3{\~{}}10{\^{}}7{\$} years. This is comparable with the energy radiated in X-rays during the same epoch. Detailed measurements of the morphology of the X-ray structure, the temperature and abundance distributions with Chandra and XMM may test this hypothesis.},

@article{Narayan1994,
abstract = {We consider viscous rotating accretion flows in which most of the viscously dissipated energy is stored as entropy rather than being radiated. Such advection-dominated flows may occur when the optical depth is either very small or very large. We obtain a family of self-similar solutions where the temperature of the accreting gas is nearly virial and the flow is quasi-spherical. The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular velocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long before they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is positive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing outflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will tend to enhance the above effects. We suggest that advection-dominated accretion may provide an explanation for the slow spin rates of accreting stars and the widespread occurrence of outflows and jets in accreting systems.},

abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega{\_}m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n{\_}s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68{\%} errors on measured parameters and 95{\%} limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N{\_} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega{\_}K| {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {We analyze Hubble Space Telescope surface-brightness profiles of 61 elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges (hot galaxies). Luminous hot galaxies have cuspy cores with steep outer power-law profiles that break at r {\~{}} r{\_}b to shallow inner profiles with logslope less than 0.3. Faint hot galaxies show steep, largely featureless power-law profiles at all radii and lack cores. The centers of power-law galaxies are up to 1000 times denser in mass and luminosity than the cores of large galaxies at a limiting radius of 10 pc. At intermediate magnitudes (-22.0 {\textless} M{\_}V {\textless} -20.5), core and power-law galaxies coexist, and there is a range in r{\_}b at a given luminosity of at least two orders of magnitude. Central properties correlate with global rotation and shape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-law galaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. The dense power-law centers of disky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-rich mergers. The parallel proposition that cores are simply the by-products of gas-free stellar mergers is less compelling. For example, core galaxies accrete small, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in low-density cores if the satellites survived and sank to the center. An alternative model for core formation involves the orbital decay of massive black holes (BHs): the BH may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any exists and scouring out a core. An average BH mass per spheroid of 0.002 times the stellar mass yields reasonably good agreement with the masses and radii of observed cores and in addition is consistent with the energetics of AGNs and kinematic detections of BHs in nearby galaxies.},

abstract = {In the early Universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes as massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy. This suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and the host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy collisions. We find that in addition to generating a burst of star formation, a merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100 million years) and explains the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion.},

@article{Bower2006,
abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at {\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembled late in hierarchical cosmologies such as cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive halos. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation; the accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process that the simulation provides results in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of local galaxies, we use it to investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We also calculate the volume averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift {\$}z\backslashsim 5{\$} and a star formation rate density which rises with increasing redshift in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierachical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

abstract = {We compare the results of various cosmological gas-dynamical codes used to simulate the formation of a galaxy in the $\Lambda$CDM structure formation paradigm. The various runs (thirteen in total) differ in their numerical hydrodynamical treatment (SPH, moving-mesh and AMR) but share the same initial conditions and adopt in each case their latest published model of gas cooling, star formation and feedback. Despite the common halo assembly history, we find large code-to-code variations in the stellar mass, size, morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z = 0, due mainly to the different implementations of star formation and feedback. Compared with observation, most codes tend to produce an overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas-rich than typical spirals, with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. A stellar disk is discernible in most simulations, although its prominence varies widely from code to code. There is a well-defined trend between the effects of feedback and the severity of the disagreement with observed spirals. In general, models that are more effective at limiting the baryonic mass of the galaxy come closer to matching observed galaxy scaling laws, but often to the detriment of the disk component. Although numerical convergence is not particularly good for any of the codes, our conclusions hold at two},

abstract = {Using a simple description of feedback from black hole (BH) growth, we develop an analytic model for the fueling of Seyferts (low-luminosity AGN) and their relation to their host galaxies, Eddington ratio distributions, and cosmological evolution. We derive a solution for evolution of accretion rates in a feedback-driven blast wave, applicable to large-scale outflows from bright quasars in galaxy mergers, low-luminosity AGN, and BHs in supernova remnants. Under the assumption that cold gas stochastically accretes onto a central SMBH at a rate set by the dynamics of that gas, our solution determines the Seyfert light curve evolution. We use this to predict the Seyfert luminosity function (LF), duty cycles, lifetimes, and distribution of host morphologies, Eddington ratios, and obscuration as a function of AGN luminosity and mass, and find agreement with observations at z=0. We consider the breakdown of contributions from this and stellar wind accretion and merger-driven activity. We make specific predictions for the weak evolution of the Seyfert LF with redshift (LF of non-merger driven activity), and for changes in both the slope and scatter of the M{\_}BH-sigma relation at low-M{\_}BH. Quiescent fueling dominates over a wide luminosity range (-14 {\textgreater} M{\_}B {\textgreater} -22) at z=0, where most BH growth occurs around M{\_}BH{\~{}}10{\^{}}7 M{\_}sun, in S0 and Sa/b galaxies. However, quasar activity from gas-rich mergers evolves more rapidly with redshift, and by z=1 quiescent fueling is important only at luminosities an order of magnitude or more below the LF break. Although non-merger driven fueling is important for BH growth and the M{\_}BH-sigma relation at low M{\_}BH, it does not significantly contribute to the total BH mass density or cosmological backgrounds.},

abstract = {We present a physically motivated model for the early co-evolution of massive spheroidal galaxies and active nuclei at their centers. Within dark matter halos, forming at the rate predicted by the canonical hierarchical clustering scenario, the gas evolution is controlled by gravity, radiative cooling, and heating by feedback from supernovae and from the growing active nucleus. Supernova heating is increasingly effective with decreasing binding energy in slowing down the star formation and in driving gas outflows. The more massive proto-galaxies virializing at earlier times are thus the sites of the faster star-formation. The correspondingly higher radiation drag fastens the angular momentum loss by the gas, resulting in a larger accretion rate onto the central black-hole. In turn, the kinetic energy carried by outflows driven by active nuclei can unbind the residual gas, thus halting both the star formation and the black-hole growth, in a time again shorter for larger halos. For the most massive galaxies the gas unbinding time is short enough for the bulk of the star-formation to be completed before type Ia supernovae can substantially increase the {\$}Fe{\$} abundance of the interstellar medium, thus accounting for the {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-enhancement seen in the largest galaxies. The feedback from supernovae and from the active nucleus also determines the relationship between the black-hole mass and the mass, or the velocity dispersion, of the host galaxy, as well as the black-hole mass function. These and other model predictions are in excellent agreement with observations for a number of observables which proved to be extremely challenging for all the current semi-analytic models, including the sub-mm counts and the corresponding redshift distributions, and the epoch-dependent K-band luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies.},

abstract = {We incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holes into semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter dominated Universe. We assume that supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. If two galaxies of comparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few percent of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a timescale of a few times 10{\^{}}7 years. With these simple assumptions, our model not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar population with redshift and the relation between the luminosities of nearby quasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number density of quasars from z=2 to z=0 is due to the combination of three effects: i) a decrease in the merging rate, ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas available to fuel black holes, and iii) an increase in the timescale for gas accretion. In a LCDM cosmology the predicted decline in the total content of cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of damped Lyman-alpha systems. Our results strongly suggest that the evolution of supermassive black holes, quasars and starbursts is inextricably linked to the hierarchical build-up of galaxies.},

abstract = {The first short part of this review is a general, but very detailed, critique of the literature advocating a class of Seyfert galaxies intrinsically lacking broad emission lines. My conclusion is that there is little or no evidence for such objects. Panchromatic properties of all types of radio loud AGN are then reviewed in detail. Radio galaxies usually show subparsec-scale radio core sources, jets, and a pair of giant radio lobes. The optical spectra sometimes show only relatively weak lines of low-ionization ionic species, and no clear nuclear continuum in the optical or UV region of the spectrum. Some show strong high-ionization narrow lines. Finally, a few radio galaxies add broad bases onto the permitted lines. These spectral categories are the same as those for radio-quiet AGN and quasars. By the 1980s, data from optical polarization and statistics of the radio properties required that many narrow line radio galaxies do in fact produce strong optical/UV continuum. This continuum and the broad line emission are hidden from the line of sight by dusty, roughly toroidal gas distributions, but they are seen in polarized flux. The radio galaxies with hidden quasars are referred to as "thermal." Do all radio galaxies harbor hidden quasars? We now know the answer using the radio, infrared, optical and X-ray properties. Near the top of the radio luminosity function, for FRII, GPS, and CSS galaxies, the answer is yes. At somewhat lower luminosities, many do not. At the lowest radio luminosities, most do not. Instead these "nonthermal" weakly-accreting galaxies manifest their energetic output only as kinetic energy in the form of synchrotron jets. This applies to all types of radio galaxies, big FR II doubles, as well as the small young GPS and CSS sources. Only a few FR I sources are of the thermal type.},

abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass and the velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from in brightest cluster ellipticals to in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105−106M...},

abstract = {We measure star formation rates of {\~{}}50,000 optically-selected galaxies in the local universe (z{\~{}}0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).},

By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z{\textless}0.2.

The majority of the star formation in the low redshift universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (10{\^{}}10-10{\^{}}11 Msun), typically in HSB disk galaxies. Roughly 15{\%} of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20{\%} occurs in starburst galaxies. We show that the present to past-average star formation rate, the Scalo b-parameter; is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}10 Msun.

abstract = {Do the theorised different formation mechanisms of fast and slow rotators produce an observable difference in their star formation histories? To study this we identify quenching slow rotators in the MaNGA sample by selecting those which lie below the star forming sequence and identify a sample of quenching fast rotators which were matched in stellar mass. This results in a total sample of 194 kinematically classified galaxies, which is agnostic to visual morphology. We use u-r and NUV-u colours from SDSS and GALEX and an existing inference package, STARPY, to conduct a first look at the onset time and exponentially declining rate of quenching of these galaxies. An Anderson-Darling test on the distribution of the inferred quenching rates across the two kinematic populations reveals they are statistically distinguishable ({\$}3.2\backslashsigma{\$}). We find that fast rotators quench at a much wider range of rates than slow rotators, consistent with a wide variety of physical processes such as secular evolution, minor mergers, gas accretion and environmentally driven mechanisms. Quenching is more likely to occur at rapid rates ({\$}\backslashtau \backslashlesssim 1{\~{}}\backslashrm{\{}Gyr{\}}{\$}) for slow rotators, in agreement with theories suggesting slow rotators are formed in dynamically fast processes, such as major mergers. Interestingly, we also find that a subset of the fast rotators quench at these same rapid rates as the bulk of the slow rotator sample. We therefore discuss how the total gas mass of a merger, rather than the merger mass ratio, may decide a galaxy's ultimate kinematic fate.},

We use three independent methods to quantify galaxy environment, namely the {\$}N{\^{}}{\{}th{\}}{\$} nearest neighbour, the tidal strength parameter {\$}Q{\$} and distinguish between central and satellite galaxies. In our analysis, we find that early-type galaxies generally exhibit shallow light-weighted age gradients in agreement with the literature and mass-weighted median age gradients tend to be slightly positive. Late-type galaxies, instead, have negative light-weighted age gradients. We detect negative metallicity gradients in both early and late-type galaxies that correlate with galaxy mass, with the gradients being steeper and the correlation with mass being stronger in late-types. We find, however, that stellar population gradients, for both morphological classifications, have no significant correlation with galaxy environment for all three characterisations of environment. Our results suggest that galaxy mass is the main driver of stellar population gradients in both early and late-type galaxies, and any environmental dependence, if present at all, must be very subtle.},

We find that the mean age and metallicity gradients are close to zero but slightly negative, which is consistent with the inside-out formation scenario. Within our sample, we find that both the age and metallicity gradients show weak or no correlation with either the LSS type or local density environment. In addition, we also study the environmental dependence of age and metallicity values at the effective radii. The age and metallicity values are highly correlated with M* and NUV-r and are also dependent on LSS type as well as local density. Low-mass galaxies tend to be younger and have lower metallicity in low-density environments while high-mass galaxies are less affected by environment.},

The fraction of kinematically misaligned galaxies varies with galaxy physical parameters, i.e. M*, SFR and sSFR. According to their sSFR, we further classify these 66 galaxies into three categories, 10 star-forming, 26 "Green Valley" and 30 quiescent ones. The properties of different types of kinematically misaligned galaxies are different in that the star-forming ones have positive gradient in D4000 and higher gas-phase metallicity, while the green valley/quiescent ones have negative D4000 gradients and lower gas-phase metallicity on average. There is evidence that all types of the kinematically misaligned galaxies tend to live in more isolated environment. Based on all these observational results, we propose a scenario for the formation of star forming galaxies with kinematically misaligned gas and stars - the progenitor accretes misaligned gas from a gas-rich dwarf or cosmic web, the cancellation of angular momentum from gas-gas collisions between the pre-existing gas and the accreted gas largely accelerates gas inflow, leading to fast centrally-concentrated star-formation. The higher metallicity is due to enrichment from this star formation. For the kinematically misaligned green valley and quiescent galaxies, they might be formed through gas-poor progenitors accreting kinematically misaligned gas from satellites which are smaller in mass.},

abstract = {We present the first multi-frequency VLBI images of PKS 2254-367, a Giga-hertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) radio source hosted by the nearby galaxy IC 1459 (D=20.5 Mpc). PKS 2254-367 and the radio source in NGC 1052 (PKS 0238-084; D=17.2 Mpc) are the two closest GPS radio sources to us, far closer than the next closest example, PKS 1718-649 (D=59 Mpc). As such, IC 1459 and NGC 1052 offer opportunities to study the details of the pc-scale radio sources as well as the environments that the radio sources inhabit, across the electromagnetic spectrum. Given that some models for the origin and evolution of GPS radio sources require a strong connection between the radio source morphology and the gaseous nuclear environment, such opportunities for detailed study are important. Our VLBI images of PKS 2254-367 show that the previously identified similarities between IC 1459 and NGC 1052 continue onto the pc-scale. Both compact radio sources appear to have symmetric jets of approximately the same luminosity, much lower than typically noted in compact double GPS sources. Similarities between PKS 2254-367 and NGC 1052, and differences with respect to other GPS galaxies, lead us to speculate that a sub-class of GPS radio sources, with low luminosity and with jet-dominated morphologies, exists and would be largely absent from radio source surveys with {\~{}}1 Jy flux density cutoffs. We suggest that this possible low-luminosity, jet-dominated population of GPS sources could be an analog of the FR-I radio galaxies, with the higher luminosity lobe-dominated GPS sources being the analog of the FR-II radio galaxies.},

@article{Wylezalek2016,
abstract = {Ionised gas outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are ubiquitous in high luminosity AGN with outflow speeds apparently correlated with the total bolometric luminosity of the AGN. This empirical relation and theoretical work suggest that in the range L{\_}bol {\~{}} 10{\^{}}43-45 erg/s there must exist a threshold luminosity above which the AGN becomes powerful enough to launch winds that will be able to escape the galaxy potential. In this paper, we present pilot observations of two AGN in this transitional range that were taken with the Gemini North Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit (IFU). Both sources have also previously been observed within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. While the MaNGA IFU maps probe the gas fields on galaxy-wide scales and show that some regions are dominated by AGN ionization, the new Gemini IFU data zoom into the centre with four times better spatial resolution. In the object with the lower L{\_}bol we find evidence of a young or stalled biconical AGN-driven outflow where none was obvious at the MaNGA resolution. In the object with the higher L{\_}bol we trace the large-scale biconical outflow into the nuclear region and connect the outflow from small to large scales. These observations suggest that AGN luminosity and galaxy potential are crucial in shaping wind launching and propagation in low-luminosity AGN. The transition from small and young outflows to galaxy-wide feedback can only be understood by combining large-scale IFU data that trace the galaxy velocity field with higher resolution, small scale IFU maps.},

abstract = {We present high spatial resolution integral-field spectroscopy of 28 elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies from the SAURON representative survey obtained with the OASIS spectrograph during its operation at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. These seeing-limited observations explore the central 8 x 10 arcsec2 (typically 1 kpc diameter) regions of these galaxies using a spatial sampling four times higher than SAURON (0.27-arcsec versus 0.94-arcsec spatial elements), resulting in almost a factor of 2 improvement in the median point spread function. These data allow accurate study of the central regions to complement the large-scale view provided by SAURON. Here we present the stellar and gas kinematics, stellar absorption-line strengths and nebular emission-line strengths for this sample. We also characterize the stellar velocity maps using the  kinemetry' technique, and derive maps of the luminosity-weighted stellar age, metallicity and abundance ratio via stellar population models. We give a brief review of the structures found in our maps, linking also to larger-scale structures measured with SAURON. We present two previously unreported kinematically decoupled components (KDCs) in the centres of NGC 3032 and NGC 4382. We compare the intrinsic size and luminosity-weighted stellar age of all the visible KDCs in the full SAURON sample, and find two types of components: kiloparsec-scale KDCs, which are older than 8 Gyr, and are found in galaxies with little net rotation; and compact KDCs, which have intrinsic diameters of less than a few hundred parsec, show a range of stellar ages from 0.5 to 15 Gyr (with 5/6 younger than 5 Gyr), are found exclusively in fast-rotating galaxies, and are close to counter-rotating around the same axis as their host. Of the seven galaxies in the SAURON sample with integrated luminosity-weighted ages less than 5 Gyr, five show such compact KDCs, suggesting a link between counter-rotation and recent star formation. We show that this may be due to a combination of small sample size at young ages, and an observational bias, since young KDCs are easier to detect than their older and/or corotating counterparts.},

H{\{}beta{\}}, [O III]{\{}lambda{\}}{\{}lambda{\}}4959,5007 and [N I]{\{}lambda{\}}{\{}lambda{\}}5198,5200 emission lines were measured using a new procedure that simultaneously fits both the stellar spectrum and the emission lines. Using this technique we can detect emission lines down to an equivalent width of 0.1 A set by the current limitations in describing galaxy spectra with synthetic and real stellar templates, rather than by the quality of our spectra. Gas velocities and velocity dispersions are typically accurate to within 14 and 20 km s-1, respectively, and at worse to within 25 and 40 km s-1. The errors on the flux of the [O III] and H{\{}beta{\}} lines are on average 10 and 20 per cent, respectively, and never exceed 30 per cent. Emission is clearly detected in 75 per cent of our sample galaxies, and comes in a variety of resolved spatial distributions and kinematic behaviours. A mild dependence on the Hubble type and galactic environment is observed, with higher detection rates in lenticular galaxies and field objects. More significant is the fact that only 55 per cent of the galaxies in the Virgo cluster exhibit clearly detected emission. The ionized-gas kinematics is rarely consistent with simple coplanar circular motions. However, the gas almost never displays completely irregular kinematics, generally showing coherent motions with smooth variations in angular momentum. In the majority of the cases, the gas kinematics is decoupled from the stellar kinematics, and in half of the objects this decoupling implies a recent acquisition of gaseous material. Over the entire sample however, the distribution of the mean misalignment values between stellar and gaseous angular momenta is inconsistent with a purely external origin. The distribution of kinematic misalignment values is found to be strongly dependent on the apparent flattening and the level of rotational support of galaxies, with flatter, fast rotating objects hosting preferentially corotating gaseous and stellar systems. In a third of the cases, the distribution and kinematics of the gas underscore the presence of non-axisymmetric perturbations of the gravitational potential. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of dust features is always accompanied by gas emission while the converse is not always true. A considerable range of values for the [O III]/H{\{}beta{\}} ratio is found both across the sample and within single galaxies. Despite the limitations of this ratio as an emission-line diagnostic, this finding suggests either that a variety of mechanisms is responsible for the gas excitation in E and S0 galaxies or that the metallicity of the interstellar material is quite heterogeneous.},

@article{Vazdekis2010,
abstract = {[Abridged]. We present SEDs for single-age, single-metallicity stellar populations (SSPs) covering the optical range at resolution 2.3A (FWHM). These SEDs constitute our base models, as they combine scaled-solar isochrones with MILES empirical stellar library, which follows the chemical evolution pattern of the solar neighbourhood. The models rely as much as possible on empirical ingredients, not just on the stellar spectra, but also on extensive photometric libraries. The unprecedented stellar parameter coverage of MILES allowed us to safely extend our optical SSP SED predictions from intermediate- to very-old age regimes, and the metallicity coverage of the SSPs from super-solar to [M/H]=-2.3. SSPs with such low metallicities are particularly useful for globular cluster studies. Observed spectra can be studied by means of full spectrum fitting or line-strengths. For the latter we propose a new Line Index System (LIS) to avoid the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the popular Lick/IDS system and provide more appropriate, uniform, spectral resolution. Apart from constant resolution as function of wavelength the system is also based on flux-calibrated spectra. Data can be analyzed at three different resolutions: 5A, 8.4A and 14A (FWHM), which are appropriate for studying globular cluster, low and intermediate-mass galaxies, and massive galaxies, respectively. Polynomials to transform current Lick/IDS line index measurements to the new system are provided. A web-page with a suite of on-line tools to facilitate the handling and transformation of the spectra is available at http://miles.iac.es.},

abstract = {We use SDSS+$\backslash$textit{\{}GALEX{\}}+Galaxy Zoo data to study the quenching of star formation in low-redshift galaxies. We show that the green valley between the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which most blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes morphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue early-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies are transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly. In contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks, and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates decline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these conclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a striking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms of the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that late-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of gas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion of the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental processes. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas supply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid quenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid. This gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger, which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, and mergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly AGN feedback.},

abstract = {New kinematic data and modeling efforts in the past few years have substantially expanded and revised dynamical measurements of black hole masses (M •) at the centers of nearby galaxies. Here we compile an updated sample of 72 black holes and their host galaxies, and present revised scaling relations between M • and stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), V-band luminosity (L), and bulge stellar mass (M bulge), for different galaxy subsamples. Our best-fitting power-law relations for the full galaxy sample are log10(M •) = 8.32 + 5.64log10($\sigma$/200 km s–1), log10(M •) = 9.23 + 1.11log10(L/1011 L ☉), and log10(M •) = 8.46 + 1.05log10(M bulge/1011 M ☉). A log-quadratic fit to the M •-$\sigma$ relation with an additional term of $\beta$2 [log10($\sigma$/200 km s–1)]2 gives $\beta$2 = 1.68 ± 1.82 and does not decrease the intrinsic scatter in M •. Including 92 additional upper limits on M • does not change the slope of the M •-$\sigma$ relation. When the early- and late-type galaxies are fit separately, we obtain similar slopes of 5.20 and 5.06 for the M •-$\sigma$ relation but significantly different intercepts—M • in early-type galaxies are about two times higher than in late types at a given sigma. Within early-type galaxies, our fits to M •($\sigma$) give M • that is about two times higher in galaxies with central core profiles than those with central power-law profiles. Our M •-L and M •-M bulge relations for early-type galaxies are similar to those from earlier compilations, and core and power-law galaxies yield similar L- and M bulge-based predictions for M •. When the conventional quadrature method is used to determine the intrinsic scatter in M •, our data set shows weak evidence for increased scatter at M bulge {\textless} 1011 M ☉ or LV {\textless} 1010.3 L ☉, while the scatter stays constant for 1011 {\textless} M bulge {\textless} 1012.3 M ☉ and 1010.3 {\textless} LV {\textless} 1011.5 L ☉. A Bayesian analysis indicates that a larger sample of M • measurements would be needed to detect any statistically significant trend in the scatter with galaxy properties.},

abstract = {By detecting ionised-gas emission in 75{\%} of the cases, the SAURON integral-field spectroscopic survey has further demonstrated that early-type galaxies often display nebular emission. Furthermore, the SAURON data have shown that such emission comes with an intriguing variety of morphologies, kinematic behaviours and line ratios. Perhaps most puzzling was the finding that round and slowly rotating objects generally display uncorrelated stellar and gaseous angular momenta, consistent with an external origin for the gas, whereas flatter and fast rotating galaxies host preferentially co-rotating gas and stars, suggesting internal production of gas. Alternatively, a bias against the internal production of ionised gas and against the acquisition of retrograde material may be present in these two kinds of objects, respectively. In light of the different content of hot gas in these systems, with slowly rotating objects being the only systems capable of hosting massive X-ray halos, we suggest that a varying importance of evaporation of warm gas in the hot interstellar medium can contribute to explain the difference in the relative behaviour of gas and stars in these two kinds of objects. Namely, whereas in X-ray bright and slowly rotating galaxies stellar-loss material would quickly evaporate in the hot medium, in X-ray faint and fast rotating objects such material would be allowed to lose angular momentum and settle in a disk, which could also obstruct the subsequent acquisition of retrograde gas. Evidence for a connection between warm and hot gas phases, presumably driven by heat conduction, is presented for four slowly rotating galaxies with Chandra observations.},

abstract = {Following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of the ionised gas in early-type galaxies we now address the question of what is powering the observed nebular emission. To constrain the likely sources of gas excitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data, draw from complementary information on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potential from the SAURON data, and use the SAURON-specific diagnostic diagram juxtaposing the [OIII]/Hb and [NI]/Hb line ratios. We find a tight correlation between the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the Hb recombination line across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as the main contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, with post-asymptotic giant branch (pAGB) stars being still the best candidate based on ionising-balance arguments. Other ionising sources such as a central AGN, OB-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of the interestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role in powering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. These results lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and AGN photoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-type galaxies by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By simulating how our sample galaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the SDSS, we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the SDSS early-type galaxies that display modest values for the equivalent width of the [OIII] line (less than {\~{}}2.4$\backslash$AA) and LINER-like [OIII]/Hb values, the nebular emission is truly powered by an AGN.},

@article{Belfiore2016,
abstract = {Using spatially resolved spectroscopy from SDSS-IV MaNGA we have demonstrated that low ionisation emission line regions (LIERs) in local galaxies result from photoionisation by hot evolved stars, not active galactic nuclei. LIERs are ubiquitous in both quiescent galaxies and in the central regions of galaxies where star formation takes place at larger radii. We refer to these two classes of galaxies as extended LIER (eLIER) and central LIER (cLIER) galaxies respectively. cLIERs are late type galaxies located around the green valley, in the transition region between the star formation main sequence and quiescent galaxies. These galaxies display regular disc rotation in both stars and gas, although featuring a higher central stellar velocity dispersion than star forming galaxies of the same mass. cLIERs are consistent with being slowly quenched inside-out; the transformation is associated with massive bulges, pointing towards the importance of bulge growth via secular evolution. eLIERs are morphologically early types and are indistinguishable from passive galaxies devoid of line emission in terms of their stellar populations, morphology and central stellar velocity dispersion. Ionised gas in eLIERs shows both disturbed and disc-like kinematics. When a large-scale flow/rotation is observed in the gas, it is often misaligned relative to the stellar component. These features indicate that eLIERs are passive galaxies harbouring a residual cold gas component, acquired mostly via external accretion. Importantly, quiescent galaxies devoid of line emission reside in denser environments and have significantly higher satellite fraction than eLIERs. Environmental effects thus represent the likely cause for the existence of line-less galaxies on the red sequence.},

We do not find a strong secondary relation of the MZR with either SFR or the sSFR for any of the calibrators, in contrast with previous single-fiber spectroscopic studies.

We model the observed {\$}H\backslashalpha{\$} emission velocity fields in the galaxies, taking projection effects and a simple model for the dust extinction into the account. We show that the vertical lag of the rotation curve is necessary in the modeling, and estimate the lag amplitude in the galaxies. We find no correlation between the lag and the star formation rate in the galaxies. At the same time, we report a correlation between the lag and the galactic stellar mass, central stellar velocity dispersion, and axial ratio of the light distribution. These correlations suggest a possible higher ratio of infalling-to-local gas in early-type disk galaxies or a connection between lags and the possible presence of hot gaseous halos, which may be more prevalent in more massive galaxies. These results again demonstrate that observations of extraplanar gas can serve as a potential probe for accretion of gas.},

Metallicity gradients of both morphological classes correlate with galaxy mass, with negative metallicity gradients becoming steeper with increasing galaxy mass. The correlation with mass is stronger for late-type galaxies, with a slope of {\$}d(\backslashnabla [Z/H])/d(\backslashlog M)\backslashsim -0.2\backslashpm 0.05\backslash;{\$}, compared to {\$}d(\backslashnabla [Z/H])/d(\backslashlog M)\backslashsim -0.05\backslashpm 0.05\backslash;{\$} for early-types.

abstract = {Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) is prevalent in star-forming galaxies. Using a sample of 365 nearly face-on star-forming galaxies observed by MaNGA, we demonstrate how DIG in star-forming galaxies impacts the measurements of emission line ratios, hence the interpretation of diagnostic diagrams and gas-phase metallicity measurements. At fixed metallicity, DIG-dominated low H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ surface brightness regions display enhanced [SII]/H$\backslash$alpha, [NII]/H$\backslash$alpha, [OII]/H$\backslash$beta, and [OI]/H$\backslash$alpha. The gradients in these line ratios are determined by metallicity gradients and H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ surface brightness. In line ratio diagnostic diagrams, contamination by DIG moves HII regions towards composite or LI(N)ER-like regions. A harder ionizing spectrum is needed to explain DIG line ratios. Leaky HII region models can only shift line ratios slightly relative to HII region models, and thus fail to explain the composite/LI(N)ER line ratios displayed by DIG. Our result favors ionization by evolved stars as a major ionization source for DIG with LI(N)ER-like emission. DIG can significantly bias the measurement of gas metallicity and metallicity gradients derived using strong-line methods. Metallicities derived using N2O2 are optimal because they exhibit the smallest bias and error. Using O3N2, R23, N2=[NII]/H$\backslash$alpha, and N2S2H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ (Dopita et al. 2016) to derive metallicities introduces bias in the derived metallicity gradients as large as the gradient itself. The strong-line method of Blanc et al. (2015; IZI hereafter) cannot be applied to DIG to get an accurate metallicity because it currently contains only HII region models which fail to describe the DIG.},

abstract = {We study the spatially resolved excitation properties of the ionized gas in a sample of 646 galaxies using integral field spectroscopy data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) programme. Making use of Baldwin–Philips–Terlevich diagnostic diagrams we demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of extended (kpc scale) low-ionization emission-line regions (LIERs) in both star-forming and quiescent galaxies. In star-forming galaxies LIER emission can be associated with diffuse ionized gas, most evident as extraplanar emission in edge-on systems. In addition, we identify two main classes of galaxies displaying LIER emission: ‘central LIER' (cLIER) galaxies, where central LIER emission is spatially extended, but accompanied by star formation at larger galactocentric distances, and ‘extended LIER' (eLIER) galaxies, where LIER emission is extended throughout the whole galaxy. In eLIER and cLIER galaxies, LIER emission is associated with radially flat, low H $\alpha$ equivalent width of line emission ({\textless}3 {\AA}) and stellar population indices demonstrating the lack of young stellar populations, implying that line emission follows tightly the continuum due to the underlying old stellar population. The H $\alpha$ surface brightness radial profiles are always shallower than 1/r2 and the line ratio [O III] $\lambda$5007/[O II] $\lambda$$\lambda$3727,29 (a tracer of the ionization parameter of the gas) shows a flat gradient. This combined evidence strongly supports the scenario in which LIER emission is not due to a central point source but to diffuse stellar sources, the most likely candidates being hot, evolved (post-asymptotic giant branch) stars. Shocks are observed to play a significant role in the ionization of the gas only in rare merging and interacting systems.},

Optical broadband imaging (using B and R filters) and narrow-band imaging (using H-alpha interference filters) have been performed to study dust patches and ionized gas. Long-split spectroscopy has also been made to determine gas kinematics and relative line ratios. The spectroscopic data confirm the presence and distribution of interstellar matter (dust lanes and ionized gas) seen in the direct imaging. Decoupled kinematics of interstellar gas and stars favors an external origin of the interstellar matter. However, for one isolated galaxy, an internal origin is not excluded. The rotation curves determined by optical emission lines are symmetric around the center in most galaxies observed. Galaxy masses and mass-to-light ratios are estimated using the rotation curves of the ionized gas.},

The models cover ages between 1 and 15 Gyr, metallicities between 1/200 and 3.5 solar. The impact from the element abundance changes on the absorption-line indices is taken from Tripicco {\&} Bell, using an extension of the method introduced by Trager et al. Our models are free from the intrinsic $\alpha$/Fe bias that was imposed by the Milky Way template stars up to now, hence they reflect well-defined $\alpha$/Fe ratios at all metallicities. The models are calibrated with Milky Way globular clusters for which metallicities and $\alpha$/Fe ratios are known from independent spectroscopy of individual stars. The metallicities that we derive from the Lick indices Mg b and Fe5270 are in excellent agreement with the metallicity scale by Zinn {\&} West, and we show that the latter provides total metallicity rather than iron abundance. We can reproduce the relatively strong CN-absorption features CN 1 and CN 2 of galactic globular clusters with models in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor of 3. An enhancement of carbon, instead, would lead to serious inconsistencies with the indices Mg 1 and C 2 4668. The calcium sensitive index Ca4227 of globular clusters is well matched by our models with [Ca/Fe] = 0.3, including the metal-rich bulge clusters NGC 6528 and 6553. From our $\alpha$/Fe-enhanced models we infer that the index [MgFe] defined by Gonz{\'{a}}lez is quite independent of $\alpha$/Fe but still slightly decreases with increasing $\alpha$/Fe.

Extensive discussion of both random and systematic errors of the Lick/IDS system is provided. Indices are seen to fall into three families: $\alpha$-element-like indices (including CN, Mg, Na D, and TiO2) that correlate positively with velocity dispersion; Fe-like indices (including Ca, the G band, TiO1, and all Fe indices) that correlate only weakly with velocity dispersion and the $\alpha$ indices; and H$\beta$ that anticorrelates with both velocity dispersion and the $\alpha$ indices.

For our sample of galaxies with a variety of morphologies and other galactic properties, we find that the specific star formation rate is a smoothly decreasing function of the ratio between black hole mass and stellar mass, or what we call the specific black hole mass. In order to explain this relation, we propose a physical framework where the gradual suppression of a galaxy's star formation activity results from the adjustment to an increase in specific black hole mass and, accordingly, an increase in the amount of heating. From this framework, it follows that at least some galaxies with intermediate specific black hole masses are in a steady state of partial quiescence with intermediate specific star formation rates, implying that both transitioning and steady-state galaxies live within this region known as the "green valley." With respect to galaxy formation models, our results present an important diagnostic with which to test various prescriptions of black hole feedback and its effects on star formation activity.},

The stellar kinematics shows an average velocity dispersion of 177km/s, circular rotation with a projected velocity amplitude of 50km/s and a kinematic major axis at a position angle of -4degrees (west of north). From the average velocity dispersion we estimate a black hole mass of M{\_}BH=8{\_}{\{}-6{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+16{\}}x10{\^{}}7 M{\_}sun. The gas kinematics is dominated by non-circular motions, mainly along two spiral arms extending from the nucleus out to 4arcsec (280pc) to the NW and SE, that are cospatial with a nuclear dusty spiral seen in a structure map of the nuclear region of the galaxy. The projected gas velocities along the spiral arms show blueshifts in the far side and redshifts in the near side, with values of up to 200km/s. This kinematics can be interpreted as gas inflows towards the nucleus along the spiral arms if the gas is in the plane of the galaxy. We estimate the mass inflow rate using two different methods. The first is based of the observed velocities and geometry of the flow, and gives a mass inflow rate in the ionised gas of 7x10{\^{}}-2 M{\_}sun/yr. In the second method, we calculate the net ionised gas mass flow rate through concentric circles of decreasing radii around the nucleus resulting in mass inflow rates ranging from 0.4 M{\_}sun/yr at 300pc down to 0.2 M{\_}sun/yr at 100pc from the nucleus. These rates are larger than necessary to power the active nucleus.},

Recent high-resolution, multiwavelength observations indicate that the bulk of this activity derives from black hole accretion with a wide range of accretion rates. The low accretion rates that typify most low-luminosity active galactic nuclei induce significant modifications to their central engine. The broad-line region and obscuring torus disappear in some of the faintest sources, and the optically thick accretion disk transforms into a three-component structure consisting of an inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow, a truncated outer thin disk, and a jet or outflow. The local census of nuclear activity supports the notion that most, perhaps all, bulges host a central supermassive black hole, although the existence of active nuclei in at least some late-type galaxies suggests that a classical bulge is not a prerequisite to seed a nuclear black hole.},

abstract = {We have measured central line strengths for a magnitude-limited sample of early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster, comprising 11 elliptical (E) and 11 lenticular (S0) galaxies, more luminous than MB=− compared with single-burst stellar population models we find that the centres of Fornax ellipticals follow a locus of fixed age and have metallicities varying roughly from half solar to twice solar. The centres of (lower luminosity) lenticular galaxies, however, exhibit a substantial spread to younger luminosity-weighted ages, indicating a more extended star formation history.
Galaxies with old stellar populations show tight scaling relations between metal-line indices and the central velocity dispersion. Remarkably also, the Fe lines are well correlated with $\sigma$0. Our detailed analysis of the stellar populations suggests that these scaling relations are driven mostly by metallicity. Galaxies with a young stellar component do generally deviate from the main relation. In particular, the lower luminosity S0s show a large spread.
Our conclusions are based on several age/metallicity diagnostic diagrams in the Lick/IDS system comprising established indices such as Mg2 and H$\beta$ as well as new and more sensitive indices such as H$\gamma$A and Fe3, a combination of three prominent Fe lines. The inferred difference in the age distribution between lenticular and elliptical galaxies is a robust conclusion, as the models generate consistent relative ages using different age and metallicity indicators, even though the absolute ages remain uncertain. The absolute age uncertainty is mainly caused by the effects of non-solar abundance ratios which are not yet accounted for by the stellar population models. Furthermore, we find that elliptical galaxies and the bulge of one bright S0 are overabundant in magnesium, where the most luminous galaxies show the strongest overabundances. The stellar populations of young and faint S0s are consistent with solar abundance ratios or a weak Mg underabundance. Two of the faintest lenticular galaxies in our sample have blue continua and extremely strong Balmer-line absorption, suggesting star formation {\textless}2 Gyr ago.},

These sources make up the bulk of the extragalactic sky, which has been studied for decades in the infrared, optical, and X-ray bands. I follow the transformation of radio astronomy by reviewing the main components of the radio sky at the bright and faint ends, the issue of their proper classification, their number counts, luminosity functions, and evolution. The overall "big picture" astrophysical implications of these results, and their relevance for a number of hot topics in extragalactic astronomy, are also discussed. The future prospects of the faint radio sky are very bright, as we will soon be flooded with survey data.

This spatial segregation of nebular emission in two physically distinct concentric zones calls for an examination of aperture effects in studies of type i+ ETGs with single-fiber spectroscopic data.},

abstract = {We present a galaxy classification system for 238 (E1-Sdm) CALIFA (Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area) galaxies based on the shapes and amplitudes of their circular velocity curves (CVCs). We infer the CVCs from the de-projected surface brightness of the galaxies, after scaling by a constant mass-to-light ratio based on stellar dynamics - solving axisymmetric Jeans equations via fitting the second velocity moment {\$}V{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}rms{\}}{\}}=\backslashsqrt{\{}V{\^{}}2+\backslashsigma{\^{}}2{\}}{\$} of the stellar kinematics. We use principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the CVC shapes to find characteristic features and use a {\$}k{\$}-means classifier to separate circular curves into classes. This objective classification method identifies four different classes, which we name slow-rising (SR), flat (FL), round-peaked (RP) and sharp-peaked (SP) circular curves. SR are typical for low-mass, late-type (Sb-Sdm), young, faint, metal-poor and disc-dominated galaxies. SP are typical for high-mass, early-type (E1-E7), old, bright, metal-rich and bulge-dominated galaxies. FL and RP appear presented by galaxies with intermediate mass, age, luminosity, metallicity, bulge-to-disk ratio and morphologies (E4-S0a, Sa-Sbc). The discrepancy mass factor, {\$}f{\_}d=1-M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/M{\_}{\{}dyn{\}}{\$}, have the largest value for SR and SP classes ({\$}\backslashsim{\$} 74 per cent and {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 71 per cent, respectively) in contrast to the FL and RP classes (with {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 59 per cent and {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 61 per cent, respectively). Circular curve classification presents an alternative to typical morphological classification and appears more tightly linked to galaxy evolution.},

abstract = {This work provides an overall characterization of the kinematic behavior of the ionized gas of the galaxies included in the Calar Alto Legacy Integral field Area (CALIFA), offering kinematic clues to potential users of this survey for including kinematical criteria for specific studies. From the first 200 galaxies observed by CALIFA, we present the 2D kinematic view of the 177 galaxies satisfying a gas detection threshold. After removing the stellar contribution, we used the cross-correlation technique to obtain the radial velocity of the dominant gaseous component. The main kinematic parameters were directly derived from the radial velocities with no assumptions on the internal motions. Evidence of the presence of several gaseous components with different kinematics were detected by using [OIII] profiles. Most objects in the sample show regular velocity fields, although the ionized-gas kinematics are rarely consistent with simple coplanar circular motions. 35{\%} of the objects present evidence of a displacement between the photometric and kinematic centers larger than the original spaxel radii. Only 17{\%} of the objects in the sample exhibit kinematic lopsidedness when comparing receding and approaching sides of the velocity fields, but most of them are interacting galaxies exhibiting nuclear activity. Early-type galaxies in the sample present clear photometric-kinematic misaligments. There is evidence of asymmetries in the emission line profiles suggesting the presence of kinematically distinct gaseous components at different distances from the nucleus. This work constitutes the first determination of the ionized gas kinematics of the galaxies observed in the CALIFA survey. The derived velocity fields, the reported kinematic peculiarities and the identification of the presence of several gaseous components might be used as additional criteria for selecting galaxies for specific studies.},

abstract = {The morphological, spectroscopic and kinematical properties of the warm interstellar medium (wim) in early-type galaxies (ETGs) hold key observational constraints to nuclear activity and the buildup history of these massive, quiescent systems. High-quality integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data with a wide spectral and spatial coverage, such as those from the CALIFA survey, offer an unprecedented opportunity for advancing our understanding of the wim in ETGs. This article centers on a 2D investigation of the wim component in 32 nearby ({\textless}{\~{}}150Mpc) ETGs from CALIFA, complementing a previous 1D analysis of the same sample (Papaderos et al. 2013; P13). We include here H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ intensity and equivalent width (EW) maps and radial profiles, diagnostic emission-line ratios, besides ionized-gas and stellar kinematics. This study is supplemented by $\backslash$tau-ratio maps as an efficient means to quantify the role of photoionization by pAGB stars, as compared to other mechanisms (e.g., AGN, low-level star formation). Additionally, we extend the tentative classification proposed in P13 by the type i+, which is assigned to a subset of type i ETGs exhibiting ongoing low-level star-formation (SF) in their periphery. This finding along with faint traces of localized SF in the extranuclear component of several of our sample ETGs points to a non-negligible contribution by OB stars to the total ionizing budget. We also demonstrate that, at the typical emission-line detection threshold of {\~{}}2$\backslash$AA in previous studies, most of the extranuclear wim emission in an ETG may evade detection, which could in turn prompt its classification as an entirely gas-devoid system. This study adds further observational evidence for a considerable heterogeneity among ETGs with regard to the physical properties and 2D kinematics of the wim component, and underscores the importance of IFS studies over their entire optical extent.},

abstract = {The growth of galaxies is one of the key problems in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe and its constituents. Galaxies can grow their stellar mass by accretion of halo or intergalactic gas clouds, or by merging with smaller or similar mass galaxies. The gas available translates into a rate of star formation, which controls the generation of metals in the universe. The spatially resolved history of their stellar mass assembly has not been obtained so far for any given galaxy beyond the Local Group. Here we demonstrate how massive galaxies grow their stellar mass inside-out. We report the results from the analysis of the first 105 galaxies of the largest to date three-dimensional spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the local universe (CALIFA). We apply the fossil record method of stellar population spectral synthesis to recover the spatially and time resolved star formation history of each galaxy. We show, for the first time, that the signal of downsizing is spatially preserved, with both inner and outer regions growing faster for more massive galaxies. Further, we show that the relative growth rate of the spheroidal component, nucleus and inner galaxy, that happened 5-7 Gyr ago, shows a maximum at a critical stellar mass {\~{}}10{\^{}}10 Msun. We also find that galaxies less massive than {\~{}}10{\^{}}10 Msun show a transition to outside-in growth, thus connecting with results from resolved studies of the growth of low mass galaxies.},

@article{Singh2013,
abstract = {Context. Galaxies, which often contain ionised gas, sometimes also exhibit a so-called low-ionisation nuclear emission line region (LINER). For 30 years, this was attributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (more commonly known as active galactic nucleus, AGN) of low luminosity, making LINER galaxies the largest AGN sub-population, which dominate in numbers over higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies and quasars. This, however, poses a serious problem. While the inferred energy balance is plausible, many LINERs clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an AGN. Aims: Using integral field spectroscopic data from the CALIFA survey, we compare the observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected from illumination by an AGN. Methods: Essential for this analysis is a proper extraction of emission lines, especially weak lines, such as Balmer H$\beta$ lines, which are superposed on an absorption trough. To accomplish this, we use the GANDALF code, which simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines. Results: For 48 galaxies with LINER-like emission, we show that the radial emission-line surface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a central point-source and hence cannot be due to an AGN alone. Conclusions: The most probable explanation for the excess LINER-like emission is ionisation by evolved stars during the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-AGB. This leads us to an entirely new interpretation. Post-AGB stars are ubiquitous and their ionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with the gas present and with stars older than {\~{}}1 Gyr unless a stronger radiation field from young hot stars or an AGN outshines them. This means that galaxies with LINER-like emission are not a class defined by a property but rather by the absence of a property. It also explains why LINER emission is observed mostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.},

We derive the half mass radius, and we find that galaxies are on average 15{\%} more compact in mass than in light. HMR/HLR decreases with increasing mass for disk galaxies, but is almost constant in spheroidal galaxies. We find that the galaxy-averaged stellar population age, stellar extinction, and {\$}\backslashmu{\$} are well represented by their values at 1 HLR. Negative radial gradients of the stellar population ages support an inside-out formation. The larger inner age gradients occur in the most massive disk galaxies that have the most prominent bulges; shallower age gradients are obtained in spheroids of similar mass. Disk and spheroidal galaxies show negative {\$}\backslashmu{\$} gradients that steepen with stellar mass. In spheroidal galaxies {\$}\backslashmu{\$} saturates at a critical value that is independent of the galaxy mass. Thus, all the massive spheroidal galaxies have similar local {\$}\backslashmu{\$} at the same radius (in HLR units). The SFH of the regions beyond 1 HLR are well correlated with their local {\$}\backslashmu{\$}, and follow the same relation as the galaxy-averaged age and {\$}\backslashmu{\$}; suggesting that local stellar mass surface density preserves the SFH of disks. The SFH of bulges are, however, more fundamentally related to the total stellar mass, since the radial structure of the stellar age changes with galaxy mass even though all the spheroid dominated galaxies have similar radial structure in {\$}\backslashmu{\$}. Thus, galaxy mass is a more fundamental property in spheroidal systems while the local stellar mass surface density is more important in disks.},

The study of galaxies in isolation is a key step towards understanding how fast-external processes, such as major mergers, affect kinematic properties in galaxies. We derived the global and individual (projected approaching and receding sides) kinematic position angles (PAs) for both the stellar and ionised gas line-of-sight velocity distributions. When compared to the photometric PA, we find that morpho-kinematic differences are smaller than 22 degrees in 90{\%} of the sample for both components; internal kinematic misalignments are generally smaller than 16 degrees. We find a tight relation between the global stellar and ionised gas kinematic PA consistent with circular-flow pattern motions in both components. This relation also holds generally in barred galaxies across the bar and galaxy disk scales. Our findings suggest that even in the presence of strong bars, both the stellar and the gaseous components tend to follow the gravitational potential of the disk. As a result, kinematic orientation can be used to assess the degree of external distortions in interacting galaxies.},

abstract = {By means of the fossil record method implemented through Pipe3D, we reconstruct the global and radial stellar mass growth histories (MGHs) of an unprecedentedly large sample of galaxies, ranging from dwarf to giant objects, from the "Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory" survey. We confirm that the main driver of the global MGHs is mass, with more massive galaxies assembling their masses earlier (downsizing), though for a given mass, the global MGHs segregate by color, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and morphological type. From the inferred radial mean MGHs, we find that at the late evolutionary stages (or for fractions of assembled mass larger than {\~{}} 80{\%}), the innermost regions formed stars on average earlier than the outermost ones (inside-out). At earlier epochs, when the age resolution of the method becomes poor, the mass assembly seems to be spatially homogeneous or even in the outside-in mode, specially for the red/quiescent/early-type galaxies. The innermost MGHs are in general more regular (less scatter around the mean) than the outermost ones. For dwarf and low-mass galaxies, we do not find evidence of an outside-in formation mode; instead their radial MGHs are very diverse most of the time, with periods of outside- in and inside-out modes (or strong radial migration), suggesting this an episodic SF history. Blue/star-forming/late-type galaxies present on average a significantly more pronounced inside-out formation mode than red/quiescent/early-type galaxies, independently of mass. We discuss our results in the light of the processes of galaxy formation, quenching, and radial migration. We discuss also on the uncertainties and biases of the fossil record method and how they could affect our results.},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy KISSR1219, which exhibits double peaked emission lines in its optical spectrum. The VLA and VLBA data reveal a one-sided core-jet structure at roughly the same position angles, providing evidence of an AGN outflow. The absence of dual parsec-scale radio cores puts the binary black hole picture in doubt for the case of KISSR1219. The high brightness temperatures of the parsec-scale core and jet components ({\$}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}6{\$} K) are consistent with this interpretation. Doppler boosting with jet speeds of {\$}\backslashgtrsim0.55c{\$} to {\$}\backslashgtrsim0.25c{\$}, going from parsec- to kpc-scales, at a jet inclination {\$}\backslashgtrsim50{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$} can explain the jet one-sidedness in this Seyfert 2 galaxy. A blue-shifted broad emission line component in [O {\{}$\backslash$sc iii{\}}] is also indicative of an outflow in the emission line gas at a velocity of {\$}\backslashsim350{\$} km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, while the [O {\{}$\backslash$sc i{\}}] doublet lines suggest the presence of shock-heated gas. A detailed line ratio study using the MAPPINGS III code further suggests that a shock+precursor model can explain the line ionization data well. Overall, our data suggest that the radio outflow in KISSR1219 is pushing the emission line clouds, both ahead of the jet and in a lateral direction, giving rise to the double peak emission line spectra.},

In integral field spectroscopy surveys, this fraction is biased because survey instruments typically only trace the inner parts of the most massive galaxies. We present aperture corrections for the two most widely used stellar kinematic quantities {\$}V/\backslashsigma{\$} and {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}R{\}}{\$}. Our demonstration involves integral field data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey and the ATLAS{\$}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}3D{\}}{\}}{\$} Survey. We find a tight relation for both {\$}V/\backslashsigma{\$} and {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}R{\}}{\$} when measured in different apertures that can be used as a linear transformation as a function of radius, i.e., a first-order aperture correction. We find that {\$}V/\backslashsigma{\$} and {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}R{\}}{\$} radial growth curves are well approximated by second order polynomials. By only fitting the inner profile (0.5{\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}e{\}}{\}}{\$}), we successfully recover the profile out to one {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}e{\}}{\}}{\$} if a constraint between the linear and quadratic parameter in the fit is applied. However, the aperture corrections for {\$}V/\backslashsigma{\$} and {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}R{\}}{\$} derived by extrapolating the profiles perform as well as applying a first-order correction. With our aperture-corrected {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}R{\}}{\$} measurements, we find that the fraction of slow rotating galaxies increases with stellar mass. For galaxies with {\$}\backslashlog M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\textgreater}{\$} 11, the fraction of slow rotators is {\$}35.9\backslashpm4.3{\$} percent, but is underestimated if galaxies without coverage beyond one {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}e{\}}{\}}{\$} are not included in the sample ({\$}24.2\backslashpm5.3{\$} percent). With measurements out to the largest aperture radius the slow rotator fraction is similar as compared to using aperture corrected values ({\$}38.3\backslashpm4.4{\$} percent). Thus, aperture effects can significantly bias stellar kinematic IFS studies, but this bias can now be removed with the method outlined here.},

abstract = {We examine the kinematic morphology of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in eight galaxy clusters in the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey. The clusters cover a mass range of 14.2{\textless}log(M{\_}200/M{\_}odot){\textless}15.2 and we measure spatially-resolved stellar kinematics for 315 member galaxies with stellar masses 10.0{\textless}log(M{\_}*/M{\_}odot){\textless}11.7 within 1R{\_}200 of the cluster centers. We calculate the spin parameter, lambda{\_}R and use that to classify the kinematic morphology of the galaxies as fast or slow rotators. The total fraction of slow rotators in the early-type galaxy population, F{\_}SR=0.14+/-0.02 and does not depend on host cluster mass. Across the eight clusters, the fraction of slow rotators increases with increasing local overdensity. We also find that the slow-rotator fraction increases at small clustercentric radii (R{\_}cl{\textless}0.3R{\_}200), and note that there is also an increase in slow-rotator fraction at R{\_}cl{\~{}}0.6R{\_}200. The slow rotators at these larger radii reside in cluster substructure. We find the strongest increase in slow-rotator fraction occurs with increasing stellar mass. After accounting for the strong correlation with stellar mass, we find no significant relationship between spin parameter and local overdensity in the cluster environment. We conclude that the primary driver for the kinematic morphology--density relationship in galaxy clusters is the changing distribution of galaxy stellar mass with local environment. The presence of slow rotators in substructure suggests that the cluster kinematic morphology--density relationship is a result of mass segregation of slow-rotating galaxies forming in groups that later merge with clusters and sink to the cluster center via dynamical friction.},

We show that the significant scatter in the {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}-j{\$} relation is accounted for by the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, the contribution of ordered motions to the dynamical support of galaxies varies by at least a factor of three. Indeed, the stellar spin parameter (quantified via {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}R{\$}) correlates strongly with S$\backslash$'ersic and concentration indices. This correlation is particularly strong once slow-rotators are removed from the sample, showing that late-type galaxies and early-type fast rotators form a continuous class of objects in terms of their kinematic properties.},

abstract = {The optical spectra of Seyfert galaxies are often dominated by emission lines excited by both star formation and AGN activity. Standard calibrations (such as for the star formation rate) are not applicable to such composite (mixed) spectra. In this paper, we describe how integral field data can be used to spectrally and spatially separate emission associated with star formation from emission associated with accretion onto an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We demonstrate our method using integral field data for two AGN host galaxies (NGC 5728 and NGC 7679) from the Siding Spring Southern Seyfert Spectroscopic Snapshot Survey (S7). The spectra of NGC 5728 and NGC 7679 form clear sequences of AGN fraction on standard emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams. We show that the emission line luminosities of the majority ({\textgreater} 85 per cent) of spectra along each AGN fraction sequence can be reproduced by linear superpositions of the emission line luminosities of one AGN dominated spectrum and one star formation dominated spectrum. We separate the Halpha, Hbeta, [N II]{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}6583, [S II]{\$}\backslashlambda \backslashlambda{\$}6716, 6731, [O III]{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}5007 and [O II]{\$}\backslashlambda \backslashlambda{\$}3726, 3729 luminosities of every spaxel into contributions from star formation and AGN activity. The decomposed emission line images are used to derive the star formation rates and AGN bolometric luminosities for NGC 5728 and NGC 7679. Our calculated values are mostly consistent with independent estimates from data at other wavelengths. The recovered star forming and AGN components also have distinct spatial distributions which trace structures seen in high resolution imaging of the galaxies, providing independent confirmation that our decomposition has been successful.},

abstract = {Most successful galaxy formation scenarios now postulate that the intense star formation in massive, high-redshift galaxies during their major growth period was truncated when powerful AGNs launched galaxy-wide outflows of gas that removed large parts of the interstellar medium. The most powerful radio galaxies at z{\~{}}2 show clear signatures of such winds, but are too rare to be good representatives of a generic phase in the evolution of all massive galaxies at high redshift. Here we present SINFONI imaging spectroscopy of 12 radio galaxies at z{\~{}}2 that are intermediate between the most powerful radio and vigorous starburst galaxies in radio power, and common enough to represent a generic phase in the early evolution of massive galaxies. The kinematic properties are diverse, with regular velocity gradients with amplitudes of Delta v=200-400 km s{\^{}}-1 as in rotating disks as well as irregular kinematics with multiple velocity jumps of a few 100 km s{\^{}}-1. Line widths are generally high, typically around FWHM=800 km s{\^{}}-1, consistent with wind velocities in hydrodynamic models. A broad H-alpha line in one target implies a black hole mass of a few 10{\^{}}9 M{\$}{\_}sun. The ratio of line widths, sigma, to bulk velocity, v, is so large that even the gas in galaxies with regular velocity fields is unlikely to be gravitationally bound. It is unclear, however, whether the large line widths are due to turbulence or unresolved, local outflows as are sometimes observed at low redshifts. Comparison of the kinetic energy with the energy supply from the AGN through jet and radiation pressure suggests that the radio source still plays a dominant role for feedback, consistent with low-redshift radio-loud quasars.},

abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of AGN can be divided into two distinct populations. The Radiative-Mode AGN are associated with black holes that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of {\~{}}1{\%} of the Eddington Limit. They are primarily associated with less massive black holes growing in high-density pseudo-bulges at a rate sufficient to produce the total mass budget in these black holes in {\~{}}10 Gyr. The circum-nuclear environment contains high density cold gas and associated star-formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback will be generic in these objects and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGN. In Jet-Mode AGN the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets). These AGN are associated with the more massive black holes in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these black holes nor star-formation in their host bulge is significant today. These AGN are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift universe are painting a similar picture. (Abridged). },

abstract = {We are currently exploiting the deep radio/optical/IR information available for the extra-galactic component of the Spitzer First Look Survey (FLS) to investigate the physical properties of faint radio-selected AGNs, with the aim of studying the AGN component of sub-mJy radio fields. One of the key unresolved issues is whether, as a function of cosmic epoch, low-power AGNs are more related to efficiently accreting systems (mostly radio-quiet) or to systems with very low accretion rates (mostly radio-loud). Here we present a sample of optically identified radio-emitting AGNs extracted from the FLS. Preliminary results show that at the flux densities probed by the FLS (S(1.4 GHz){\textgreater} 100 microJy) we still have a significant number of radio-loud AGNs, similarly to what found in 'brighter' sub-mJy radio samples. Very interestingly, however, we have also a clear and direct evidence of a population of radio-emitting AGNs in the FLS, whose properties are consistent with those expected from existing radio-quiet AGN modeling. Such AGNs could be recognised as such thanks to the availability of IR colors which proved to be especially useful to efficiently separate radio sources triggered by AGNs, from sources triggered by star-formation. This latter result supports the idea that radio-quiet AGNs are not necessarily radio silent, and very promisingly may indicate that the bulk of the radio-quiet AGN population could emerge from studies of deeper radio samples.},

This supports$\backslash$nthe interpretation of a common non-thermal origin of the nuclear$\backslash$nemission also for CoreG. The luminosities of the nuclear sources, most$\backslash$nlikely dominated by jet emission, set firm upper limits, as low as$\backslash$nL/L{\_}Edd ˜ 10-9 in both the optical and X-ray band, on$\backslash$nany emission from the accretion process. The similarity of CoreG and$\backslash$nLLRG when considering the distributions host galaxies luminosities and$\backslash$nblack hole masses, as well as of the surface brightness profiles,$\backslash$nindicates that they are drawn from the same population of early-type$\backslash$ngalaxies. LLRG represent only the tip of the iceberg associated with$\backslash$n(relatively) high activity levels, with CoreG forming the bulk of the$\backslash$npopulation. We do not find any relationship between radio-power and$\backslash$nblack hole mass. A minimum black hole mass of M{\_}BH = 108$\backslash$nMȯ is apparently associated with the radio-loud nuclei$\backslash$nin both CoreG and LLRG, but this effect must be tested on a sample of$\backslash$nless luminous galaxies, likely to host smaller black holes. In the$\backslash$nunifying model for BL Lacs and radio-galaxies, CoreG likely represent$\backslash$nthe counterparts of the large population of low luminosity BL Lac now$\backslash$nemerging from the surveys at low radio flux limits. This suggests the$\backslash$npresence of relativistic jets also in these quasi-quiescent early-type$\backslash$n"core" galaxies.},

The radio source is of very low luminosity and in projection is confined within the optical image of NGC 1399. It consists of two antiparallel jets that merge with diffuse lobes. A comparison between the minimum radio pressures and the thermal pressures inferred from X-ray models indicates that the radio source is most likely confined. The source may be intrinsically small because the jets are initially of low Mach number, so that they turbulently entrain the ISM, decelerate, and rapidly terminate in lobes that contain no hot spots or sharp edges.},

We describe the structure of the main algorithm and show that it performs much better than the standard 2D approach on velocity fields. A number of successful applications, from high to very low spatial resolution data are presented and discussed. 3D Barolo can recover the true rotation curve and estimate the intrinsic velocity dispersion even in barely resolved galaxies (∼2 resolution elements) provided that the signal to noise of the data is larger that 2-3. It can also be run automatically thanks to its source-detection and first-estimate modules, which make it suitable for the analysis of large 3D datasets. These features make 3D Barolo a uniquely useful tool to derive reliable kinematics for both local and high-redshift galaxies from a variety of different instruments including the new-generation IFUs, ALMA and the SKA pathfinders.},

We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galax-ies, composite active galactic nucleus–H II (AGN–H II) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [O III] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distin-guished by their [O III] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[O III]/$\sigma$ 4 , which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[O III]/$\sigma$ 4 , all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/L EDD and Seyferts dominant at high L/L EDD . These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.},

abstract = {We present results from a series of follow-up observations of a sub-sample of the representative SAURON survey elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies using the OASIS integral-field spectrograph. These observations focus on the central 10" x 10", with roughly double the spatial resolution of the SAURON observations. This increased spatial resolution reveals a number of interesting and previously unresolved features in the measured stellar kinematics and absorption-line strengths. We find that galaxies exhibiting the youngest global stellar populations (as measured with SAURON) often contain a distinctly young central region (on scales of a few hundred parsec or less) compared to the rest of the galaxy. Moreover, these compact, young components are found to be mostly counter-rotating with respect to the rest of the galaxy. Given that there is no well-established reason for such young components to `prefer' counter- over co-rotation, this finding raises the following questions: How common are these small KDCs as a function of age? Why are there more young than old compact KDCs? Where are the equivalent co-rotating components? We explore these questions using simple simulated velocity fields and stellar population models, and find that the fading of the young component as it evolves, coupled with the fact that counter-rotating components are more easily detected in the velocity field, may help explain the observed trends.},

abstract = {Combined Spitzer, Chandra, XMM-Newton, and VLA observations of the giant radio galaxy NGC 1316 (Fornax A) show a radio jet and X-ray cavities from active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts most likely triggered by a merger with a late-type galaxy at least 0.4 Gyr ago. We detect a weak nucleus with a spectral energy distribution typical of a low-luminosity AGN with a bolometric luminosity of 2.4 × 1042 erg s–1. We examine the Spitzer IRAC and MIPS images of NGC 1316. We find that the dust emission is strongest in regions with little or no radio emission and that the particularly large infrared luminosity relative to the galaxy's K-band luminosity implies an external origin for the dust. The inferred dust mass implies that the merger spiral galaxy had a stellar mass of (1-6) ×1010 M ☉ and a gas mass of (2-4) ×109 M ☉. X-ray cavities in the Chandra and XMM-Newton images likely result from the expansion of relativistic plasma ejected by the AGN. The soft (0.5-2.0 keV) Chandra images show a small {\~{}}15'' (1.6 kpc) cavity coincident with the radio jet, while the XMM-Newton image shows two large X-ray cavities lying 320'' (34.8 kpc) east and west of the nucleus, each approximately 230'' (25 kpc) in radius. Current radio observations do not show emission within these cavities. The radio lobes lie at radii of 14farcm3 (93.3 kpc) and 15farcm6 (101 kpc), more distant from the nucleus than the detected X-ray cavities. The relative morphology of the large scale 1.4 GHz and X-ray emission suggests they were products of two distinct outbursts, an earlier one creating the radio lobes and a later one producing the X-ray cavities. Alternatively, if a single outburst created both the X-ray cavities and the radio lobes, this would require that the radio morphology is not fully defined by the 1.4 GHz emission. For the more likely two outbursts scenarios, we use the buoyancy rise times to estimate an age for the more recent outburst that created the X-ray cavities of 0.1 Gyr and the PV work done by the expanding plasma that created the X-ray cavities to estimate the outburst's energy to be 1058 erg. The present size and location of the radio lobes imply that the outburst that created them happened {\~{}}0.4 Gyr ago and released {\~{}}5 × 1058 erg.},

abstract = {Astronomers have long believed cold mo-lecular gas provides the fuel for ongoing star formation. This phase of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) is cold and dense, thus tight-ly bound in galactic disks. Removing such gas requires vast amounts of energy. While strong starbursts can drive winds and strip gas on galaxy scales, this occurs only when star-formation rates run high. Another way to input large amounts of en-ergy into the ISM is by harnessing the power of an accreting super-massive black-hole (i.e. an active galactic nucleus, AGN). AGN can unleash powerful jets capable of directly driving gas from a galaxy, or output vast amounts of electromagnetic energy that can destroy or accelerate gas clouds. Some tentative evidence links AGN to the quenching process that turns galaxies red. For instance, AGN seem to be more common in the transition region, between the red se-quence and the blue star-forming galaxies. Astronomers have also detected outflows of ionized and neutral gas (detected in absorp-tion) associated with powerful AGN. direct evidence that AGN can drive the cold molec-ular gas from a galaxy, though, was scarce. This has all changed in the past few years, however, with a quick succession of discov-eries of several large AGN-powered molecu-lar outflows.},

abstract = {We present two-dimensional (2D) mapping of the stellar velocity field within the inner 5 ′′ of six nearby active galaxies, using spectra obtained with the Integral Field Unit of the GMOS instrument at the Gemini North telescope. The sampling of the observations is 0. ′′ 2, corresponding at the galaxies to spatial extents ranging from 10 to 30 pc. The spatial resolution range from 20 to about 180 pc, and the observed field of view covers a few hundred parsecs around the nuclei. The Calcium II triplet absorption features at ≈ 850 A were used to measure the stellar radial velocities and velocity dispersions. The radial velocity fields are dominated by rotation in all galaxies. A simple kinematical model assuming a purely rotating system with circular orbits in a plane was fitted to the radial velocity data. The turnover of the rotation curve is at only ≈ 50 pc for NGC 4051 and between 200 and 700 pc for the other 5 galaxies. The velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) maps show the largest values (100 $\sigma$ 150 km s −1) at the centre. In the cases of NGC 2273 and NGC 3227, there is a decrease to $\sigma$ ≈ 70 − 80 km s −1 at ≈ 200 − 300 pc from the nucleus, delineating partial rings of low $\sigma$ values. A similar broken ring seems to be present at ≈ 400 pc from the nucleus also in NGC 4593. We interpret these low $\sigma$ rings as traces of recently formed stars that partially keep the cold kinematics of the original gas from which they have formed. In NGC 3516 there is a decrease of $\sigma$ outwards with the steepest gradient observed along the direction of the galaxy major axis, where $\sigma$ reaches ≈ 80 − 90 km s −1 at ≈ 400 pc from the nucleus. The main novelty of the present work is the unprecedented spatial resolution reached by a 2D study of stellar kinematics of Seyfert galaxies using an IFU. The few similar IFU studies available in the literature for Seyfert galaxies have a much poorer spatial resolution and/or are restricted to the study of emission line kinematics.},

abstract = {Context. The light of the merger remnant NGC 1316 (Fornax A) is dominated by old and intermediate-age stars. The only sign of current star formation in this big galaxy is the HII region SH2, an isolated star cluster complex with a ring-like morphology and an estimated age of 0.1 Gyr at a galactocentric distance of about 35 kpc. A nearby intermediate-age globular cluster, surrounded by weak line emission and a few more young star clusters, is kinematically associated. The origin of this complex is enigmatic. Aims. We want to investigate the nature of this star cluster complex. The nebular emission lines permit a metallicity determination which can discriminate between a dwarf galaxy or other possible precursors. Methods. We used the Integrated Field Unit (IFU) of the VIMOS instrument at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory in high dispersion mode to study the morphology, kinematics, and metallicity employing line maps, velocity maps, and line diagnostics of a few characteristic spectra. Results. The line ratios of different spectra vary, indicating highly structured HII regions, but define a locus of uniform metallicity. The strong-line diagnostic diagrams and empirical calibrations point to a nearly solar or even super-solar oxygen abundance. The velocity dispersion of the gas is highest in the region offset from the bright clusters. Star formation may be active on a low level. There is evidence for a large-scale disk-like structure in the region of SH2, which would make the similar radial velocity of the nearby globular cluster easier to understand. Conclusions. The high metallicity does not fit to a dwarf galaxy as progenitor. We favour the scenario of a free-floating gaseous complex having its origin in the merger 2 Gyr ago. Over a long period the densities increased secularly until finally the threshold for star formation was reached. SH2 illustrates how massive star clusters can form outside starbursts and without a considerable field population.},

@article{Cappellari2016a,
abstract = {I start by providing an updated summary of the penalized pixel-fitting (pPXF) method, which is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the stellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the problem of extracting the kinematic when the velocity dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} is smaller than the velocity sampling {\$}\backslashDelta V{\$}, which is generally, by design, close to the instrumental dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm inst{\}}{\$}. The standard approach consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when {\$}\backslashsigma{\textless}\backslashDelta V/2{\$}, due to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of the under-sampled kernel, and instead directly computes its well-sampled analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available pPXF software. The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities regardless of {\$}\backslashsigma{\$}. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys targeting galaxies with {\$}\backslashsigma\backslashll\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm inst{\}}{\$}, for galaxy redshift determinations, or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms used in today's popular software packages.},

abstract = {We present new observational results that conclude that the nearby radio galaxy B2 0722+30 is one of the very few known disc galaxies in the low-redshift Universe that host a classical double-lobed radio source. In this paper, we use HI observations, deep optical imaging, stellar population synthesis modelling and emission-line diagnostics to study the host galaxy, classify the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and investigate environmental properties under which a radio-loud AGN can occur in this system. Typical for spiral galaxies, B2 0722+30 has a regularly rotating gaseous disc throughout which star formation occurs. Dust heating by the ongoing star formation is likely responsible for the high infrared luminosity of the system. The optical emission-line properties of the central region identify a Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region (LINER)-type nucleus with a relatively low [OIII] luminosity, in particular when compared with the total power of the Fanaroff {\&} Riley type-I radio source that is present in this system. This classifies B2 0722+30 as a classical radio galaxy rather than a typical Seyfert galaxy. The environment of B2 0722+30 is extremely HI-rich, with several nearby interacting galaxies. We argue that a gas-rich interaction involving B2 0722+30 is a likely cause for the triggering of the radio AGN and/or the fact that the radio source managed to escape the optical boundaries of the host galaxy.},

abstract = {Most massive galaxies show emission lines that can be characterized as LINERs. To what extent this emission is related to AGNs or to stellar processes is still an open question. In this paper, we analysed a sample of such galaxies to study the central region in terms of nuclear and circumnuclear emission lines, as well as the stellar component properties. For this reason, we selected 10 massive ({\$}\backslashsigma{\$} {\textgreater} 200 km/s) nearby (d {\textless} 31 Mpc) galaxies and observed them with the IFU/GMOS (integral field unit/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph) spectrograph on the Gemini South Telescope. The data were analysed with principal component analysis (PCA) Tomography to assess the main properties of the objects. Two spectral regions were analysed: a yellow region (5100-5800 A), adequate to show the properties of the stellar component, and a red region (6250-6800 A), adequate to analyse the gaseous component. We found that all objects previously known to present emission lines have a central AGN-type emitting source. They also show gaseous and stellar kinematics typical of discs. Such discs may be co-aligned (NGC 1380 and ESO 208 G-21), in counter-rotation (IC 1459 and NGC 7097) or misaligned (IC 5181 and NGC 4546). We also found one object with a gaseous disc but no stellar disc (NGC 2663), one with a stellar disc but no gaseous disc (NGC 1404), one with neither stellar nor gaseous disc (NGC 1399) and one with probably ionization cones (NGC 3136). PCA Tomography is an efficient method for detecting both the central AGN and gaseous and stellar discs. In the two cases (NGC 1399 and NGC 1404) in which no lines were previously reported, we found no evidence of either nuclear or circumnuclear emission, using PCA Tomography only.},

abstract = {We investigate the well-known correlations between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and other global observables of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics to about one effective (half-light) radius Re. They have well-calibrated I-band Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 and large-field ground-based photometry, accurate surface brightness fluctuation distances, and their observed kinematics is consistent with an axisymmetric intrinsic shape. All these factors result in an unprecedented accuracy in the M/L measurements. We find a tight correlation of the form (M/L) = (3.80 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.14) x ({\{}sigma{\}}e/200 km s-1)0.84{\{}+/-{\}}0.07 between the M/L (in the I band) measured from the dynamical models and the luminosity-weighted second moment {\{}sigma{\}}e of the LOSVD within Re. The observed rms scatter in M/L for our sample is 18 per cent, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is [{\~{}}]13 per cent. The (M/L)-{\{}sigma{\}}e relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight correlations between {\{}sigma{\}}e and other galaxy global observables. The comparison of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the tilt' of the FP of early-type galaxies, describing the deviation of the FP from the virial relation, is almost exclusively due to a real M/L variation, while structural and orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. When the photometric parameters are determined in the classic' way, using growth curves, and the {\{}sigma{\}}e is measured in a large aperture, the virial mass appears to be a reliable estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies, and can be safely used where more expensive' models are not feasible (e.g. in high-redshift studies). In this case the best-fitting virial relation has the form (M/L)vir = (5.0 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.1) xRe{\{}sigma{\}}[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}/(LG), in reasonable agreement with simple theoretical predictions. We find no difference between the M/L of the galaxies in clusters and in the field. The comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)pop inferred from the analysis of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in early-type galaxies of [{\~{}}]30 per cent of the total mass inside one Re, in broad agreement with previous studies, and it also shows that the stellar initial mass function varies little among different galaxies. Our results suggest a variation in M/L at constant (M/L)pop, which seems to be linked to the galaxy dynamics. We speculate that fast-rotating galaxies have lower dark matter fractions than the slow-rotating and generally more-massive ones. If correct, this would suggest a connection between the galaxy assembly history and the dark matter halo structure. The tightness of our correlation provides some evidence against cuspy nuclear dark matter profiles in galaxies.},

This is very similar to the mass-to-light ratio found for NGC 4555 and confirms that isolated ellipticals can possess sizable dark matter haloes. We find a significantly lower mass-to-light ratio for NGC 7796, 10.6 (+2.5,-2.3) Msol/Lsol at 5 Re, and discuss the possibility that NGC 7796 hosts a galactic wind, causing us to underestimate its mass.},

@article{Prandoni2010,
abstract = {Context. It has recently been proposed that the jets of low-luminosity radio galaxies are powered by direct accretion of the hot phase of the IGM onto the central black hole. Cold gas remains a plausible alternative fuel supply, however. The most compelling evidence that cold gas plays a role in fueling radio galaxies is that dust is detected more commonly and/or in larger quantities in (elliptical) radio galaxies compared with radio-quiet elliptical galaxies. On the other hand, only small numbers of radio galaxies have yet been detected in CO (and even fewer imaged), and whether or not all radio galaxies have enough cold gas to fuel their jets remains an open question. If so, then the dynamics of the cold gas in the nuclei of radio galaxies may provide important clues to the fuelling mechanism. Aims: The only instrument capable of imaging the molecular component on scales relevant to the accretion process is ALMA, but very little is yet known about CO in southern radio galaxies. Our aim is to measure the CO content in a complete volume-limited sample of southern radio galaxies, in order to create a well-defined list of nearby targets to be imaged in the near future with ALMA. Methods: APEX [This publication is based on data acquired with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX). APEX is a collaboration between the Max-Planck-Institut fur Radioastronomie, the European Southern Observatory, and the Onsala Space Observatory.] has recently been equipped with a receiver (APEX-1) able to observe the 230 GHz waveband. This allows us to search for CO(2-1) line emission in our target galaxies. Results: Here we present the results for our first three southern targets, proposed for APEX-1 spectroscopy during science verification: NGC 3557, IC 4296 and NGC 1399. The experiment was successful with two targets detected, and possible indications for a double-horned CO line profile, consistent with ordered rotation.

abstract = {Rotation data are presented for 13 elliptical galaxies, and compared with the oblate models of Gott (1975), Larson (1975), and Wilson (1975). It is found that, on average, most elliptical galaxies have one-third the peak rotational velocity required by these models, with an estimated upper limit of two-thirds the expected rotation. This result is independent of the distance scale. Oblate models in which the flattening is a result of rotation appear to be precluded by these data. Plausible alternatives appear to be that ellipticals are (1) triaxial ellipsoids (or oblate spheroids) in which the flattening is due to remnant anisotropy in the velocity distribution, as suggested by Binney (1978), or (2) rotating prolate ellipsoids, as suggested by Miller (1978). Curiously, one giant elliptical rotates as expected.},

abstract = {We discuss our analysis of long-slit optical spectra of the emission- line nebulae associated with 21 low-redshift (z 〈0.2) radio galaxies. We complement our data with similar data from the literature on 19 other low-redshift radio galaxies. We find that the nebulae can be classified kinematically into three types: rotators, calm nonrotators, and violent nonrotators. The kinematic classification correlates with the relative emission-line strengths in the nebulae and with the optical and radio properties of the galaxies. The nebulae in the rotator class have [O I] 6300 A, [N II] 6584 A, and [S II] 6717 A emission lines that are weak relative to H$\alpha$. The rotators are nearly always associated with galaxies having luminous "high-ionization" nuclear emission-line regions and powerful edge-brightened (Fanaroff and Riley Class II) radio sources. The ionization of the nebulae in these sources is most likely dominated by photoionization from the nuclear continuum source. These galaxies usually inhabit regions of only modest galaxy density. Their radio jet and gas rotation axes are typically aligned to within 20{\^{}}deg{\^{}}. The calm nonrotator nebulae have [O I], [N II], and [S II] lines that are strong relative to H$\alpha$. They are preferentially associated with galaxies having "low-ionization" nuclear emission-line regions and less powerful, edge-dimmed (Fanaroff {\&} Riley Class I) or amorphous radio sources. Heating and photoionization by the surrounding hot (10{\^{}}7-8{\^{}} K) ISM/ICM is likely to provide an important component of the ionization of the nebulae in these sources. These galaxies generally inhabit regions of high galaxy density. The violent nonrotators seem to be more similar to the rotators in their optical/radio properties. We propose that the rotators have dynamically young disks of gas recently acquired by the radio galaxy in an interaction or merger with a gas-rich galaxy. This is consistent with the data on the morphologies, colors, and stellar dynamics of radio galaxies with strong emission lines. This gas may fuel the nuclear activity and appears to be influential in the good collimation of these classical double (FRII class) radio sources. The calm nonrotators include seven radio galaxies with well-known "cooling flows." We suggest that these nebulae are in general the optical signature of a cooling flow which may fuel the active nucleus. The violent nonrotators may be related to the rotators, but either tidal forces or interactions with outflowing radio plasma have induced large noncircular motions in the ionized gas. The association of the large-scale gas kinematics with the radio and optical properties of the active galaxy then suggests that the angular momentum of the gas which fuels the AGN may be an important parameter in the determinant of how activity is manifest in an AGN.},

@article{Allen2006,
abstract = {Using Chandra X-ray observations of nine nearby, X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies with good optical velocity dispersion measurements, we show that a tight correlation exists between the Bondi accretion rates calculated from the observed gas temperature and density profiles and estimated black hole masses, and the power emerging from these systems in relativistic jets. The jet powers, which are inferred from the energies and time-scales required to inflate cavities observed in the surrounding X-ray emitting gas, can be related to the accretion rates using a power-law model of the form log(PBondi/1043ergs-1) = A + Blog(Pjet/1043ergs-1), with A = 0.65 +/- 0.16 and B = 0.77 +/- 0.20. Our results show that a significant fraction of the energy associated with the rest mass of material entering the Bondi accretion radius (2.2+1.0-0.7 per cent, for Pjet = 1043ergs-1) eventually emerges in the relativistic jets. The data also hint that this fraction may rise slightly with increasing jet power. Our results have significant implications for studies of accretion, jet formation and galaxy formation. The observed tight correlation suggests that the Bondi formulae provide a reasonable description of the accretion process in these systems, despite the likely presence of magnetic pressure and angular momentum in the accreting gas. The similarity of the PBondi and Pjet values argues that a significant fraction of the matter entering the accretion radius flows down to regions close to the black holes, where the jets are presumably formed. The tight correlation between PBondi and Pjet also suggests that the accretion flows are approximately stable over time-scales of a few million years. Our results show that the black hole `engines' at the hearts of large elliptical galaxies and groups can feed back sufficient energy to stem cooling and star formation, leading naturally to the observed exponential cut off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function.},

abstract = {Radio AGN feedback is often assumed to work, but detailed physical models of this process are not well developed. This paper examines a possible path for radio AGN feedback to heat the gas in and around galaxies and perhaps suppress star formation. Nearby radio AGN are almost all FR-I radio galaxies, and it is argued that such outflows become decelerated and fully turbulent in their early stages. A 3D non-linear MHD turbulence calculation is made to determine the time required for this outflowing turbulent energy to be converted into heat. Using radio and x-ray observations of nearby FR-I AGN for normalization results in a time for the onset of heating of about 100 million years. This is comparable to the gas cooling times in and around galaxies, and the resulting location of heat deposition is consistent with FR-I outflows.},

The principal result is that between one-fourth and one-third of very powerful radio galaxies are strongly peculiar in optical morphology at relatively high levels of surface brightness. This fraction is much greater than for less powerful radio galaxies and for radio-quiet ellipticals. The morphological peculiarities take the form of tails, fans, bridges, dust features, shells, etc. They probably arise from the collision or merger of galaxy pairs, at least one member of which is a disk galaxy. Two idealized classes of radio galaxies are proposed. Class A galaxies have strong optical emission lines and frequently peculiar optical morphologies. These may be radio sources fueled by collisions or mergers involving at least one gas-rich system. Class B galaxies have weak or no optical emission lines and are morphologically normal giant elliptical or cD galaxies. These radio sources may be powered by the stored rotational energy of a central black hole or by accretion of an intracluster medium.},

Using single stellar population model spectral energy distributions by Vazdekis (1999) we find that the LOSVD corrections are largely insensitive to changes in the stellar populations for old galaxies (age {\textgreater}3 Gyr). Only the Lick/IDS Balmer series indices show an appreciable effect, which is on the order of the correction itself. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of the LOSVD corrections to non-Gaussian LOSVDs. In this case the LOSVD can be described by a Gauss-Hermite series and it is shown that typical values of h{\_}3 and h{\_}4 observed in early-type galaxies can lead to significant modifications of the LOSVD corrections and thus to changes in the derived luminosity weighted ages and metallicities. A new, simple parameterisation for the LOSVD corrections, taking into account the h{\_}3 and h{\_}4 terms, is proposed and calibrations given for a subset of the Lick/IDS indices and two additional indices applicable to old ({\textgreater}3 Gyr) stellar populations.},

abstract = {We present a method for determining mean light-weighted ages and abundances of Fe, Mg, C, N, and Ca, from medium resolution spectroscopy of unresolved stellar populations. The method, pioneered by Schiavon (2007), is implemented in a publicly available code called EZ{\_}Ages. The method and error estimation are described, and the results tested for accuracy and consistency, by application to integrated spectra of well-known Galactic globular and open clusters. Ages and abundances from integrated light analysis agree with studies of resolved stars to within +/-0.1 dex for most clusters, and to within +/-0.2 dex for nearly all cases. The results are robust to the choice of Lick indices used in the fitting to within +/-0.1 dex, except for a few systematic deviations which are clearly categorized. The realism of our error estimates is checked through comparison with detailed Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we apply EZ{\_}Ages to the sample of galaxies presented in Thomas et al. (2005) and compare our derived values of age, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] to their analysis. We find that [alpha/Fe] is very consistent between the two analyses, that ages are consistent for old (Age {\textgreater} 10 Gyr) populations, but show modest systematic differences at younger ages, and that [Fe/H] is fairly consistent, with small systematic differences related to the age systematics. Overall, EZ{\_}Ages provides accurate estimates of fundamental parameters from medium resolution spectra of unresolved stellar populations in the old and intermediate-age regime, for the first time allowing quantitative estimates of the abundances of C, N, and Ca in these unresolved systems. The EZ{\_}Ages code can be downloaded at http://www.ucolick.org/{\~{}}graves/EZ{\_}Ages.html},

abstract = {We have re-studied line-strength gradients of 80 elliptical galaxies. Typical metallicity gradients are d[Fe/H]/dlogr = -0.3. The metallicity gradients do not correlate with any physical properties of galaxies, including central and mean metallicities, central velocity dispersions sigma0, absolute B-magnitudes MB, absolute effective radii Re, and dynamical masses of galaxies. By using the metallicity gradients, we have calculated mean stellar metallicities for individual ellipticals. Typical mean stellar metallicities are {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater} = -0.3. The mean metallicities correlate well with sigma0 and dynamical masses, though relations for MB and Re include significant scatters. We find fundamental planes defined by surface brightnesses SBe, {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater}, and Re (or MB), and the scatters of which are much smaller than those of the {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater}-Re (or MB) relations. The {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater}-sigma0 relation is nearly in parallel to the [Fe/H]0- sigma0 relation but systematically lower by 0.3 dex. The metallicity-mass relation, or equivalently, the color-magnitude relation holds not only for the central part but also for the whole part of galaxies. Using Mg2 and Fe1, we find {\textless}[Mg/Fe]{\textgreater} = +0.2 in most of ellipticals. {\textless}[Mg/Fe]{\textgreater} shows no correlation with galaxy mass tracers. This can be most naturally explained if the star formation had stopped in ellipticals before the bulk of Type Ia supernovae began to explode. Ellipticals can have significantly different metallicity gradients and {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater} even if they have the same galaxy mass. This may result from galaxy mergers, but no evidence is found from presently available data to support the same origin for metallicity gradients, the scatters around metallicity-mass relation, and dynamical disturbances. This may suggest that the scatters have their origin at the formation epoch of galaxies.},

abstract = {We study the stellar populations of 1,923 elliptical galaxies at z{\textless}0.05 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a function of velocity dispersion, sigma, and environment. We construct average, high signal-to-noise spectra and find the following: (1) lower-sigma galaxies have a bluer optical continuum and stronger (but still weak) emission lines; (2) at fixed sigma, field ellipticals have a slightly bluer stellar continuum, especially at wavelengths $\backslash$lesssim 4000 $\backslash$AA, and have stronger (but still weak) emission lines compared to their group counterparts, although this environmental dependence is strongest for low-sigma ellipticals. Based on Lick indices measured from both the individual and average spectra, we find that: (1) at a given sigma, elliptical galaxies in groups have systematically weaker Balmer absorption than their field counterparts, although this environmental dependence is most pronounced at low sigma; (2) there is no clear environmental dependence of {\textless}Fe{\textgreater}, while the alpha-element absorption indices such as Mgb are only slightly stronger in galaxies belonging to rich groups. An analysis based on simple stellar populations (SSPs) reveals that more massive elliptical galaxies are older, more metal-rich and more strongly alpha-enhanced. We also find that: (1) the SSP-equivalent ages of galaxies in rich groups are, on average, {\~{}}1 Gyr older than in the field, although once again this effect is strongest at low sigma; (2) galaxies in rich groups have slightly lower [Fe/H] and are marginally more strongly alpha-enhanced; and (3) there is no significant environmental dependence of total metallicity, [Z/H]. Our results are generally consistent with stronger low-level recent star formation in field ellipticals at low sigma, similar to recent results based on ultraviolet and infrared observations.

abstract = {We have investigated the properties of a volume and magnitude limited sample of nearby early type galaxies that were carefully selected from the AAO two degree field galaxy redshift survey. We used images from the DSS to confirm the E/S0 morphologies, and augmented this sample with field galaxies from Colbert et al. 2001. We present spectroscopic observations of 22 galaxies from the combined sample, from which central velocity dispersions and the Lick stellar population indices were measured. After carefully correcting the spectra for nebular emission we derived luminosity-weighted ages, metallicities, and alpha-element abundance ratios. We compare these isolated galaxies with samples of early-type galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters, and also with the sample of galaxies in low-density regions of Kuntschner et al. (2002). We find that galaxies in low-density environments are younger and have a greater spread of ages compared to cluster galaxies. They also show a wider range of metallicities at a given velocity dispersion than cluster galaxies, which display only super-solar metallicities. On average cluster, as well as, isolated galaxies show non-solar abundance ratios in alpha-elements, suggesting that, independent of galactic environment, star formation occurred on short time-scales. We reason that early-type galaxies in low-density environments experienced merging-induced star-formation episodes over a longer and more recent period of time compared to a cluster environment, and speculate that a considerable fraction of their stars formed out of low-metallicity halo gaseous material during the slow growth of a stellar disk between merging events.},

We find that the BGGs and BCGs have very uniform masses, central ages and central metallicities. Examining the radial dependence of their stellar populations, we find no significant velocity dispersion, age, or alpha-enhancement gradients. However, we find a wide range of metallicity gradients, suggesting a variety of formation mechanisms. The range of metallicity gradients observed is surprising given the homogeneous environment these galaxies probe and their uniform central stellar populations. However, our results are inconsistent with any single model of galaxy formation and emphasize the need for more theoretical understanding of both the origins of metallicity gradients and galaxy formation itself. We postulate two possible physical causes for the different formation mechanisms.},

abstract = {There is good evidence that the centers of massive early-type galaxies have a bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) compared to the IMF of the Milky Way. Here we study the radial variation of the IMF within such galaxies, using a combination of high quality Keck spectroscopy and a new suite of stellar population synthesis models that cover a wide range in metallicity. As in the previous studies in this series, the models are fitted directly to the spectra and treat all elemental abundance ratios as free parameters. Using newly obtained spectroscopy for six galaxies, including deep data extending to {\~{}}1Re for the galaxies NGC1407, NGC1600, and NGC2695, we find that the IMF varies strongly with galactocentric radius. For all six galaxies the IMF is bottom-heavy in the central regions, with average mass-to-light ratio "mismatch" parameter a{\~{}}2.5 at r=0. The IMF rapidly becomes more bottom-light with increasing radius, flattening off near the Milky Way value (a{\~{}}1.1) at R{\textgreater}0.4Re. A consequence is that the luminosity-weighted average IMF depends on the measurement aperture: within R=Re we find {\textless}a{\textgreater}=1.3-1.5, consistent with recent lensing and dynamical results from SLACS and ATLAS-3D. Our results are also consistent with several earlier studies that were based on analyses of radial gradients of line indices. The observed IMF gradients support galaxy formation models in which the central regions of massive galaxies had a different formation history than their outer parts. Finally, we make use of the high signal-to-noise central spectra of NGC1407 and NGC2695 to demonstrate that we are indeed measuring IMF effects, not abundance effects.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution Very Large Array imaging of the molecular gas in the host galaxy of the high redshift quasar BRI 1335-0417 (z=4.41). Our CO(2-1) observations have a linear resolution of 0.15" (1.0 kpc) and resolve the molecular gas emission both spatially and in velocity. The molecular gas in BRI 1335-0417 is extended on scales of 5 kpc, and shows a complex structure. At least three distinct components encompassing about two thirds of the total molecular mass of 9.2 x 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun are identified in velocity space, which are embedded in a structure that harbors about one third of the total molecular mass in the system. The brightest CO(2-1) line emission region has a peak brightness temperature of 61+/-9 K within 1 kpc diameter, which is comparable to the kinetic gas temperature as predicted from the CO line excitation. This is also comparable to the gas temperatures found in the central regions of nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, which are however much more compact than 1 kpc. The spatial and velocity structure of the molecular reservoir in BRI 1335-0417 is inconsistent with a simple gravitationally bound disk, but resembles a merging system. Our observations are consistent with a major, gas-rich (`wet') merger that both feeds an accreting supermassive black hole (causing the bright quasar activity), and fuels a massive starburst that builds up the stellar bulge in this galaxy. Our study of this z{\textgreater}4 quasar host galaxy may thus be the most direct observational evidence that `wet' mergers at high redshift are related to AGN activity.},

abstract = {We have analyzed Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 F555W and F814W (i.e., V and I) images for 15 elliptical galaxies with kinematically distinct cores. For each of them, we have derived surface brightness and isophotal parameter profiles in the two bands, color maps, and radial profiles in V - I. Most galaxies show patchy dust absorption close to their nuclei. However, there are generally no indications of homogeneous, diffuse dust components close to the nuclei. The nuclear colors in the unobscured regions are most likely representative of the central stellar populations.

We have detected photometric evidence for faint stellar disks, on scales of a few tens to a few arcseconds, in seven galaxies, namely NGC 1427, 1439, 1700, 4365, 4406, 4494, and 5322. In NGC 1700, the isophotes are slightly boxy at the scale of the counterrotating component and disky at larger radii. We find no difference in V - I color greater than 0.02 mag between these disks and the surrounding galactic regions. Hence, the stellar populations in the kinematically distinct cores are not strongly deviant from the population of the main body. Specifically, there is no evidence for a dominating population of blue, very metal weak stars as predicted by some of the formation scenarios. This argues against models in which small galaxies fall in and survive in the nuclei, unless supermassive black holes are present. These would likely disrupt the accreted small systems.

For one galaxy, NGC 4365, the innermost region is bluer than the surrounding regions. This area extends to {\~{}}15 pc and contains a luminosity of {\~{}}2.5 × 106 L☉. If interpreted as a stellar population effect, an age difference of {\~{}}3-4 Gyr, or an [Fe/H] variation of about 0.2 dex, is derived.

The nuclear intensity profiles show a large variety: some galaxies have steep cusp profiles, while others have shallow cusps and a "break radius." The nuclear cusps of galaxies with kinematically distinct cores follow the same trends as the nuclei of normal galaxies.

We have not been able to identify a unique, qualifying feature in the WFPC2 images that distinguishes the galaxies with kinematically distinct cores from the kinematically normal cores. It is possible that statistical differences exist: possibly, the kinematically distinct cores have a higher fraction of nuclear disks. The similarity of both types of cores puts strong constraints on the formation scenarios. Simulations of galaxy mergers, with the inclusion of star formation and nuclear black holes, are needed to resolve the question of how these structures may have formed. Spectra with high spatial resolution are needed to study the nuclear structure of the distinct component in detail.},

These trends are in good agreement with observations of early-type galaxies, and are consistent with a `downsizing' galaxy formation scenario: more massive galaxies have formed the bulk of their stars earlier and more rapidly, hence from an interstellar medium that was mostly {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-enriched by massive stars. In the absence of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), however, {\$}[\backslashalpha/\backslashmathrm{\{}Fe{\}}]{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$} in {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}} {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} galaxies is roughly constant with stellar mass and decreases with mean stellar age, extending the trends found for lower-mass galaxies in both simulations with and without AGN. We conclude that AGN feedback can account for the {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-enhancement of massive galaxies, as it suppresses their star formation, quenching more massive galaxies at earlier times, thereby preventing the iron from longer-lived intermediate-mass stars (supernova Type Ia) from being incorporated into younger stars.},

abstract = {The second catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in two years of scientific operation is presented. The Second LAT AGN Catalog (2LAC) includes 1017 gamma-ray sources located at high Galactic latitudes (|b|{\textgreater}10{\{}$\backslash$deg{\}}) that are detected with a test statistic greater than 25 and associated statistically with AGNs. However some of these are affected by analysis issues and some are associated with multiple AGNs. Consequently we define a clean sample which includes 886 AGNs, comprising 395 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), 310 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 157 candidate blazars of unknown type (i.e., with broad-band blazar characteristics but with no optical spectral measurement yet), eight misaligned AGNs, four narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1s), 10 AGNs of other types and two starburst galaxies. Where possible, the blazars have been further classified based on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as archival radio, optical, and X-ray data permit. While almost all FSRQs have a synchrotron-peak frequency 10{\^{}}14 Hz, about half of the BL Lacs have a synchrotron-peak frequency {\textgreater}10{\^{}}15 Hz. The 2LAC represents a significant improvement relative to the First LAT AGN Catalog (1LAC), with 52{\%} more associated sources. The full characterization of the newly detected sources will require more broad-band data. Various properties, such as gamma-ray fluxes and photon power law spectral indices, redshifts, gamma-ray luminosities, variability, and archival radio luminosities---and their correlations are presented and discussed for the different blazar classes. The general trends observed in 1LAC are confirmed.},

abstract = {We present a multi-scale and multi-frequency study of the radio galaxy IC1531 (z=0.026) with Chandra, XMM-Newton and Fermi. The Chandra image shows an X-ray core and 5 extended emission with the radio jet. The X-ray spectrum of the core is well fitted by a power law ({\OE}{\`{i}}=2.2). The X-ray emission of the large scale jet is most-likely synchrotron emission, further confirming the low-power source classication. The gamma-ray analisys shows a 5-days variability, from which it is possible to estimate the size of the emitting region. We present a study of the spectral energy distribution of the core of IC1531 from radio to gamma-ray emission. The models allowed us to determine the nature of the gamma-ray emission and infer the jet kinetic power at sub-pc scales. The jet power at kpc scales is estimated from the total radio luminosity at 151 MHz. Finally, we compare the jet power with the disk luminosity. We discuss our results in terms of the formation and evolution of the jet.},

abstract = {We study a sample of 44 low-luminosity radio-loud AGN, which represent a range of nuclear radio-power spanning 5 orders of magnitude, to unveil the accretion mechanism in these galaxies. We estimate the accretion rate of gas associated with their hot coronae by analyzing archival Chandra data, to derive the deprojected density and temperature profiles in a spherical approximation. Measuring the jet power from the nuclear radio-luminosity, we find that the accretion power correlates linearly with the jet power, with an efficiency of conversion from rest mass into jet power of {\~{}}0.012. These results strengthen and extend the validity of the results obtained by Allen and collaborators for 9 radio galaxies, indicating that hot gas accretion is the dominant process in FR I radio galaxies across their full range of radio-luminosity. We find that the different levels of nuclear activity are driven by global differences in the structure of the galactic hot coronae. A linear relation links the jet power with the host X-ray surface brightness. This implies that a substantial change in the jet power must be accompanied by a global change in its ISM properties, driven for example by a major merger. This correlation provides a simple widely applicable method to estimate the jet-power of a given object by observing the intensity of its host X-ray emission. To maintain the mass flow in the jet, the fraction of gas that crosses the Bondi radius reaching the accretion disk must be {\textgreater} 0.002. This implies that the radiative efficiency of the disk must be {\textless} 0.005, an indication that accretion in these objects occurs not only at a lower rate, but also at lower efficiency than in standard accretion disks.},

abstract = {Early-type galaxies (E and S0) are cornerstones in the study of galaxy formation and evolution as their stellar populations provide strong constraints on these processes, specially when associated to its mass and environment. In order to do this kind of study we used spectroscopic observations carried out at the 1.52 m ESO telescope for a sample of 509 early-type galaxies. We performed two types of spectra extraction: one takes into account most of the light of the galaxy, and is refered as global extraction; the other one consists of several contiguous, and small extractions along the major axis of the galaxy to allow gradient studies for a sub-sample of 137 galaxies. We measured several indices in the Lick system and using the SSP model of Thomas et al. (2003) we determine ages and metallicities. Examining the index-$\sigma$0 relation, we do not find any significant difference for it, taking into account distinct morphologies and environments. The slope of this relation seems to be chiefly caused by variation of metallicity, and secondarily by [$\alpha$/Fe] and age. We also find a correlation between residuals of this relation with the H$\beta$ index, an age indicator, however the residuals for Mg and Fe indexes show different behaviors with H$\beta$. This suggests that variation in [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio also plays a role in the scatter of the index-$\sigma$0 relation, rather than age alone. Examining the parameters obtained from SSP models and how it relate to mass ($\sigma$0), we find that low mass galaxies viii present [Z/H], ages and [$\alpha$/Fe] values, on average, smaller than that of massive objects, confirming what is generally known as the downsizing effect. No clear effects of distinct morphologies and environments are reported on the relations between age, [Z/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] with mass. Average values of ∆I are similar for both morphological types and environments, nevertheless, their distributions are not. The ∆I-$\sigma$0 or ∆[Z/H]-$\sigma$0 do not depend on morphology or surroundings, and also do not show correlation with $\sigma$0. Also, ∆T and ∆[$\alpha$/Fe] show no significant correlation with $\sigma$0, and have a distribution consistent with a null average. The above evidences favours both scenarios, Monolithic Dissipative Collapse and Hierarchical Clustering, so we may consider a unified scenario for galaxy formation where in a clustering scenery, galaxies can form rapidly as in a monolithic dissipative like process.},

abstract = {We report on spectroscopic observations of three elliptical galaxies, NGC 4472, NGC 5813 and IC 4296. Rotation curves, velocity dispersion profiles and line-strength profiles have been obtained using two methods, the Fourier quotient method of Sargent et al. (1977) and the cross-correlation method of Tonry {\&} Davis. Good agreement was found between these methods. NGC 4472 and 5813 are found to rotate slowly, providing additional support to the hypothesis that the shapes of elliptical galaxies are due to velocity anisotropics rather than rotation. IC 4296 rotates quite rapidly, consistent with isotropic oblate models. Spectra obtained along the minor axis of each galaxy show little evidence for minor axis rotation, except possibly for NGC 5813. The velocity dispersion profiles for NGC 5813 and IC 4296 are flat, implying a mass distribution $\rho$(r)∝r−2$\rho$(r)∝r−2. Isophotometry has been obtained for each galaxy. NGC 4472 and 5813 show isophote twists and outwardly increasing ellipticities. Mass to light ratios have been determined for each galaxy and also for 10 galaxies in Schechter {\&} Gunn's sample. We find (M/L)B∼7(M/L)B∼7 in the inner regions (r ≈ 5kpc) of elliptical galaxies (assuming H0 = 50 km s−1 Mpc−1).},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the measurements of the absorption line-strength Lick indices in the early-type galaxy IC 1459. We use the long-slit spectra of the elliptical galaxy IC 1459 from which its kinematics had previously been extracted to calculate the Lick indices for the observed spectral region (Mg2, Fe5270, Fe5335 and H$\beta$). We apply the usual procedure and correct the indices to the Lick spectral resolution and for the zero velocity dispersion. The procedure applied in this paper also corrects to non-Gaussian line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) observed in this galaxy, especially in its outer parts. The findings of Kuntschner (2004) were tested and it is shown that the departures from the Gaussian LOSVD may indeed cause erroneous determinations of the Lick indices. The impact of the introduction of non-Gaussian LOSVD differs for different indices. For the galaxy IC 1459 it is shown that the iron indices are especially sensitive when the correction due to anistropies is introduced: the corrections for Fe5270 and Fe5335 are {\~{}}10 and {\~{}}19 percent larger, respectively, than the corrections obtained in case of a pure Gaussian. The corrections for Mg2 index are shown to be negligible and the corrections of the H$\beta$ index due to anisotropies are also small (below {\~{}} 4 per cent at most).},

Using Parkes data we find evidence of additional extended, low-column-density HI emission around IC 5270, indicating that the clouds are the tip of the iceberg of a larger system of gas surrounding this galaxy. This result adds to the body of evidence on the presence of intra-group gas within the IC 1459 group. Altogether, the HI found outside galaxies in this group amounts to several times {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, at least 10{\%} of the HI contained inside galaxies. This suggests a substantial flow of gas in and out of galaxies during the several billion years of the group's evolution.},

abstract = {The source of hot gas in elliptical galaxies is thought to be due to stellar mass loss, with contributions from supernova events and possibly from infall from a surrounding environment. This picture predicts supersolar values for the metallicity of the gas toward the inner part of the galaxy, which can be tested by measuring the gas phase abundances. We use high-quality data for 10 nearby early-type galaxy from XMM-Newton, featuring both the EPIC and the Reflection Grating Spectrometer, where the strongest emission lines are detected with little blending; some Chandra data are also used. We find excellent consistency in the elemental abundances between the different XMM instruments and good consistency with Chandra. Differences in abundances with aperture size and model complexity are examined, but large differences rarely occur. For a two-temperature thermal model plus a point source contribution, the median Fe and O abundances are 0.86 and 0.44 of the Solar value, while Si and Mg abundances are similar to that for Fe. This is similar to stellar abundances for these galaxies but supernovae were expected to enhance the gas phase abundances considerably, which is not observed.},

abstract = {We present an initial analysis of a new XMM observation of NGC 1399, the central elliptical galaxy of the Fornax group. Spectral fitting of the spatially resolved spectral data of the EPIC MOS and pn CCDs reveals that a two-temperature model (2T) of the hot gas is favored over single-phase and cooling flow models within the central {\~{}}20 kpc. The preference for the 2T model applies whether or not the data are deprojected. The cooler component has a temperature ({\~{}}0.9 keV) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars while the hotter component has a temperature ({\~{}}1.5 keV) characteristic of the virial temperature of a {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}} M{\_}sun halo. The two-phase model (and other multitemperature models) removes the ``Fe Bias'' within r {\textless} {\~{}}20 kpc and gives Z{\_}Fe/Z{\_}sun 1.5-2. At larger radii the iron abundance decreases until Z{\_}Fe/Z{\_}sun $\backslash${\~{}}0.5 for r {\~{}}50 kpc. The Si abundance is super-solar (1.2-1.7 solar) within the central regions while Z{\_}Si/Z{\_}Fe {\~{}}0.8 over the entire region studied. These Fe and Si abundances imply that {\~{}}80{\%} of the Fe mass within r {\~{}}50 kpc originates from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). This SNIa fraction is similar to that inferred for the Sun and therefore suggests a stellar initial mass function similar to the Milky Way.},

We obtained WFPC2 narrow-band imaging centered on the Halpha+[NII] emission lines to determine the flux distribution of the gas emission at small radii, and we obtained FOS spectra at six aperture positions along the major axis to sample the gas kinematics. We construct different dynamical models for the Halpha+[NII] and Hbeta kinematics that include a supermassive black hole, and in which the stellar mass distribution is constrained by the observed surface brightness distribution and ground-based stellar kinematics.

abstract = {This paper characterizes the radial structure of stellar population properties of galaxies in the nearby universe, based on 300 galaxies from the CALIFA survey. The sample covers a wide range of Hubble types, and galaxy stellar mass. We apply the spectral synthesis techniques to recover the stellar mass surface density, stellar extinction, light and mass-weighted ages, and mass-weighted metallicity, for each spatial resolution element in our target galaxies. To study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individual radial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology. We confirm that more massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and less reddened by dust. Additionally, we find that these trends are preserved spatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. Deviations from these relations appear correlated with Hubble type: earlier types are more compact, older, and more metal rich for a given mass, which evidences that quenching is related to morphology, but not driven by mass. Negative gradients of ages are consistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest ages gradients in Sb-Sbc galaxies. Further, the mean stellar ages of disks and bulges are correlated, with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late type spirals hosting younger disks. The gradients in stellar mass surface density depend mostly on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive galaxies are more centrally concentrated. There is a secondary correlation in the sense that at the same mass early type galaxies have steeper gradients. We find mildly negative metallicity gradients, shallower than predicted from models of galaxy evolution in isolation. The largest gradients occur in Sb galaxies. Overall we conclude that quenching processes act in manners that are independent of mass, while metallicity and galaxy structure are influenced by mass-dependent processes.},

abstract = {MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) is a 6-year SDSS-IV survey that will obtain resolved spectroscopy from 3600 {\$}\backslashAA{\$} to 10300 {\$}\backslashAA{\$} for a representative sample of over 10,000 nearby galaxies. In this paper, we derive spatially resolved stellar population properties and radial gradients by performing full spectral fitting of observed galaxy spectra from P-MaNGA, a prototype of the MaNGA instrument. These data include spectra for eighteen galaxies, covering a large range of morphological type. We derive age, metallicity, dust and stellar mass maps, and their radial gradients, using high spectral-resolution stellar population models, and assess the impact of varying the stellar library input to the models. We introduce a method to determine dust extinction which is able to give smooth stellar mass maps even in cases of high and spatially non-uniform dust attenuation. With the spectral fitting we produce detailed maps of stellar population properties which allow us to identify galactic features among this diverse sample such as spiral structure, smooth radial profiles with little azimuthal structure in spheroidal galaxies, and spatially distinct galaxy sub-components. In agreement with the literature, we find the gradients for galaxies identified as early-type to be on average flat in age, and negative (- 0.15 dex / R{\$}{\_}e{\$} ) in metallicity, whereas the gradients for late-type galaxies are on average negative in age (- 0.39 dex / R{\$}{\_}e{\$} ) and flat in metallicity. We demonstrate how different levels of data quality change the precision with which radial gradients can be measured. We show how this analysis, extended to the large numbers of MaNGA galaxies, will have the potential to shed light on galaxy structure and evolution.},

abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

The galaxies span a factor of 20 in intrinsic luminosity, as well as a full range of environment and ETG morphology. Our data consist of good velocity resolution (sigma{\_}inst {\~{}} 25 km/s) integrated stellar-light spectra extracted from the individual slitlets of custom made Keck/DEIMOS slitmasks. We extract stellar kinematics measurements (V, sigma, h{\_}3, and h{\_}4) for each galaxy. Combining with literature values from smaller radii, we present 2D spatially resolved maps of the large-scale kinematic structure in each galaxy. We find that the kinematic homogeneity found inside 1 R{\_}e often breaks down at larger radii, where a variety of kinematic behaviors are observed. While central slow rotators remain slowly rotating in their halos, central fast rotators show more diversity, ranging from rapidly increasing to rapidly declining specific angular momentum profiles in the outer regions. There are indications that the outer trends depend on morphological type, raising questions about the proposed unification of the elliptical and lenticular (S0) galaxy families in the ATLAS{\^{}}3D survey. Several galaxies in our sample show multiple lines of evidence for distinct disk components embedded in more slowly rotating spheroids, and we suggest a joint photometric-kinematic approach for robust bulge-disk decomposition. Our observational results appear generally consistent with a picture of two-phase (in-situ plus accretion) galaxy formation.},

The library covers the range ll8348–9020 at 1.5-{\AA} (FWHM) spectral resolution, and consists of 706 stars spanning a wide range in atmospheric parameters. We have defined a new set of near-IR indices, CaT*, CaT and PaT, which mostly overcome the limitations of previous definitions, the former being specially suited for the measurement of the Ca II triplet strength corrected for the contamination from Paschen lines. We also present a comparative study of the new and the previous Ca indices, as well as the corresponding transformations between the different systems. A thorough analysis of the sources of index errors and the procedure to calculate them is given. Finally, index and error measurements for the whole stellar library are provided together with the final spectra. With this paper we start a series dedicated to the empirical calibration of the near-IR Ca II triplet. The ultimate aim of this work is to use the strength of the Ca lines in this spectral range to investigate the stellar content of early-type galaxies. However, we expect that researchers in different areas (e.g. starburst and active galaxies, globular clusters, and stellar astrophysics) can make use of some of the results and information that will be presented throughout these papers. These include a new stellar library, a set of homogeneous atmospheric parameters, empirical fitting functions describing the behaviour of the Ca triplet with the stellar parameters, and stellar population model predictions.},

abstract = {While studies of gas-phase metallicity gradients in disc galaxies are common, very little has been done in the acquisition of stellar abundance gradients in the same regions. We present here a comparative study of the stellar metallicity and age distributions in a sample of 62 nearly face-on, spiral galaxies with and without bars, using data from the CALIFA survey. We measure the slopes of the gradients and study their relation with other properties of the galaxies. We find that the mean stellar age and metallicity gradients in the disc are shallow and negative. Furthermore, when normalized to the effective radius of the disc, the slope of the stellar population gradients does not correlate with the mass or with the morphological type of the galaxies. Contrary to this, the values of both age and metallicity at {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2.5 scale-lengths correlate with the central velocity dispersion in a similar manner to the central values of the bulges, although bulges show, on average, older ages and higher metallicities than the discs. One of the goals of the present paper is to test the theoretical prediction that non-linear coupling between the bar and the spiral arms is an efficient mechanism for producing radial migrations across significant distances within discs. The process of radial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and, therefore, we would expect flatter stellar metallicity gradients in barred galaxies. However, we do not find any difference in the metallicity or age gradients in galaxies with without bars. We discuss possible scenarios that can lead to this absence of difference.},

We find a large variety of kinematics: from non- to highly-rotating objects, often associated with underlying disky isophotes revealed by deep images from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. In half of our objects, we find a centrally-concentrated younger and more metal-rich stellar population. We analyze the specific stellar angular momentum through the lambdaR parameter and find six fast-rotators and two slow-rotators, one having a thin counter-rotating disk. We compare the local galaxy density and stellar populations of our objects with those of 39 more extended low-mass Virgo ETGs from the SMAKCED survey and 260 massive ({\$}M{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$}$\backslash$Msun) ETGs from the A3D sample. The compact low-mass ETGs in our sample are located in high density regions, often close to a massive galaxy and have, on average, older and more metal-rich stellar populations than less compact low-mass galaxies. We find that the stellar population parameters follow lines of constant velocity dispersion in the mass-size plane, smoothly extending the comparable trends found for massive ETGs. Our study supports a scenario where low-mass compact ETGs have experienced long-lived interactions with their environment, including ram-pressure stripping and gravitational tidal forces, that may be responsible for their compact nature.},

Here, age and metallicity estimates for local cluster and field ETGs are reviewed as based on color-magnitude, color-sigma, and fundamental plane relations, as well as on spectral-line indices diagnostics. The results of applying the same tools at high redshifts are then discussed, and their consistency with the low-redshift results is assessed. Most low- as well as high-redshift (z{\~{}}1) observations consistently indicate 1) a formation redshift z{\textgreater}{\~{}}3 for the bulk of stars in cluster ETGs, with their counterparts in low-density environments being on average {\~{}}1-2 Gyr younger, i.e., formed at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}1.5-2, 2) the duration of the major star formation phase anticorrelates with galaxy mass, and the oldest stellar populations are found in the most massive galaxies. With increasing redshift there is evidence for a decrease in the number density of ETGs, especially of the less massive ones, whereas existing data appear to suggest that most of the most-massive ETGs were already fully assembled at z{\~{}}1. Beyond this redshift, the space density of ETGs starts dropping significantly, and as ETGs disappear, a population of massive, strongly clustered, starburst galaxies progressively becomes more and more prominent, which makes them the likely progenitors to ETGs.},

abstract = {The strength of the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} index has been computed for the integrated spectra of model globular clusters from the evolutionary population synthesis. These models take into account, for the first time, the detailed systematic variation of horizontal-branch (HB) morphology with age and metallicity. Our models show that the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} index is significantly affected by the presence of blue HB stars. Because of the contribution from blue HB stars, the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} does not monotonically decrease as metallicity increases at a given age. Instead, it reaches a maximum strength when the distribution of HB stars is centered around 9500 K, the temperature where the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} index becomes strongest. Our models indicate that the strength of the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} index increases as much as 0.75 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} due to the presence of blue HB stars. The comparison of the recent Keck observations of the globular cluster system in the Milky Way Galaxy with those in giant elliptical galaxies, NGC 1399 and M87, shows a systematic shift in the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} against metallicity plane. Our models suggest that this systematic difference is understood if the globular cluster systems in giant elliptical galaxies are several billion years older, in the mean, than the Galactic counterpart. Further observations of globular cluster systems in the external galaxies from the large ground-based telescopes and space UV facilities will enable to clarify whether this difference is indeed due to the age difference or other explanations are also possible.},

abstract = {The present paper reviews our current understanding of the AGN component in sub-mJy radio fields, as it results from the exploitation of multi-frequency information available in two deep extra-galactic radio fields: the ATESP 5 GHz sample and the First Look Survey. One of the key issues addressed here is whether low-power AGNs are more related to efficiently accreting systems (mostly radio-quiet) or to systems with very low accretion rates (mostly radio-loud). The emerging picture is the following. Radio-loud jet-dominated radio galaxies seem to be largely dominant down to flux densities of the order of e.g. S{\textgreater}400 microJy. At lower flux densities (S(1.4 GHz) {\textgreater} 100 microJy) radio-loud AGN are still present in significant numbers. However a population of radio-emitting AGNs, whose properties are consistent with those expected from existing radio-quiet AGN modeling, clearly shows up. This may indicate that the bulk of the radio-quiet AGN population could emerge from studies of deeper (S{\textless}100 microJy) radio samples. The radio-quiet AGN component could be recognised thanks to the availability of IR colors which prove to be especially useful to efficiently separate radio sources triggered by AGNs, from sources triggered by star-formation.},

abstract = {We present a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher-order moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of galaxies observed with integral-field spectrographs. The generalisation follows the approach of surface photometry by determining the best fitting ellipses along which the profiles of the moments can be extracted and analysed by means of harmonic expansion. The assumption for the odd moments (e.g. mean velocity) is that the profile along an ellipse satisfies a simple cosine law. The assumption for the even moments (e.g velocity dispersion) is that the profile is constant, as it is used in surface photometry. We find that velocity profiles extracted along ellipses of early-type galaxies are well represented by the simple cosine law (with 2{\%} accuracy), while possible deviations are carried in the fifth harmonic term which is sensitive to the existence of multiple kinematic components, and has some analogy to the shape parameter of photometry. We compare the properties of the kinematic and photometric ellipses and find that they are often very similar. Finally, we offer a characterisation of the main velocity structures based only on the kinemetric parameters which can be used to quantify the features in velocity maps (abridged).},

abstract = {We define a method for analysis of the integrated spectra of extra-galactic globular clusters that provides more reliable measures of age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance ratio than have so far been achieved. The method involves the simultaneous fitting of up to 25 Lick indices in a chi-squared-fitting technique that maximises the use of the available data. Here we compare three sets of single stellar population (SSP) models of Lick indices to the high signal-to-noise, integrated spectra of 20 Galactic globular clusters. The ages, [Fe/H] and alpha-element abundance ratios derived from the SSP models are compared to the results of resolved stellar population studies from the literature. We find good consistency with the published values, with an agreement of better than 0.1 dex in all three derived parameters. The technique allows identification of abundance ratio anomalies, such as the known nitrogen over-abundance in Galactic globular clusters, and the presence of anomalous horizontal-branch morphologies. It also minimises the impact on the derived parameters of imperfect calibration to the Lick system, and reduction errors in general. The method defined in this work is therefore robust with respect to many of the difficulties that plague the application of SSP models in general, and is, consequently, well suited to the study of extra-galactic globular cluster systems.},

The models cover ages between 1 and 15 Gyr, metallicities between 1/200 and 3.5 solar. Our models are free from the intrinsic alpha/Fe bias that was imposed by the Milky Way template stars up to now, hence they reflect well-defined alpha/Fe ratios at all metallicities. The models are calibrated with Milky Way globular clusters for which metallicities and alpha/Fe ratios are known from independent spectroscopy of individual stars. The metallicities that we derive from the Lick indices Mgb and Fe5270 are in excellent agreement with the metallicity scale by Zinn {\&} West (1984), and we show that the latter provides total metallicity rather than iron abundance. We can reproduce the relatively strong CN-absorption features CN1 and CN2 of galactic globular clusters with models in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor three. An enhancement of carbon, instead, would lead to serious inconsistencies with the indices Mg1 and C24668. The calcium sensitive index Ca4227 of globular clusters is well matched by our models with [Ca/Fe]= 0.3, including the metal-rich Bulge clusters NGC 6528 and NGC 6553. From our alpha/Fe enhanced models we infer that the index [MgFe] defined by Gonzalez (1993) is quite independent of alpha/Fe, but still slightly decreases with increasing alpha/Fe. We define a slight modification of this index that is completely independent of alpha/Fe and serves best as a tracer of total metallicity. Searching for blue indices that give similar information as Mgb and Fe, we find that CN1 and Fe4383 may be best suited to estimate alpha/Fe ratios of objects at redshifts z{\~{}}1. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We perform a spectroscopic study to constrain the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) by using a large sample of 24,781 early-type galaxies from the SDSS-based SPIDER survey. Clear evidence is found of a trend between IMF and central velocity dispersion, sigma0, evolving from a standard Kroupa/Chabrier IMF at 100km/s towards a more bottom-heavy IMF with increasing sigma0, becoming steeper than the Salpeter function at sigma0{\textgreater}220km/s. We analyze a variety of spectral indices, corrected to solar scale by means of semi-empirical correlations, and fitted simultaneously with extended MILES (MIUSCAT) stellar population models. Our analysis suggests that sigma0, rather than [alpha/Fe], drives the IMF variation. Although our analysis cannot discriminate between a single power-law (unimodal) and a low-mass ({\textless}0.5MSun) tapered (bimodal) IMF, we can robustly constrain the fraction in low-mass stars at birth, that is found to increase from 20{\%} at sigma0{\~{}}100km/s, up to 80{\%} at sigma0{\~{}}300km/s. Additional constraints can be provided with stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios: unimodal models predict M/L significantly larger than dynamical M/L, across the whole sigma0 range, whereas a bimodal IMF is compatible. Our results are robust against individual abundance variations. No significant variation is found in Na and Ca in addition to the expected change from the correlation between [alpha/Fe] and sigma0.

abstract = {The construction of detailed models for intermediate and old stellar populations is described. Input parameters include metallicity (-2 less than (Fe/H) less than 0.5), single-burst age (between 1.5 and 17 Gyr), and initial mass function (IMF) exponent. Quantities output include broadband magnitudes, spectral energy distributions, surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes, and a suite of 21 absorption feature indices. The models are checked against a wide variety of available observations. Examinations of model output yield the following conclusions. (1) If the percentage change delta age/delta Z approximately equals 3/2 for two populations, they will appear almost identical in most indices. A few indices break this degeneracy by being either more abundance sensitive (Fe4668, Fe5015, Fe5709, and Fe5782) or more age sensitive (G4300, H beta, and presumably higher order Balmer lines) than usual. (2) Present uncertainties in stellar evolution are of the same magnitude as the effects of IMF and Y in the indices studied. (3) Changes in abundance ratios (like (Mg/Fe)) are predicted to be readily apparent in the spectra of old stellar populations. (4) The I-band flux of a stellar population is predicted to be nearly independent of metallicity and only modestly sensitive to age. The I band is therefore recommended for standard candle work or studies of M/L in galaxies. Other conclusions stem from this work. (1) Intercomparison of models and observations of two TiO indices seem to indicate variation of the (V/Ti) ratio among galaxies, but it is not clear how this observation ties into the standard picture of chemical enrichment. (2) Current estimates of (Fe/H) for the most metal-rich globulars that are based on integrated indices are probably slightly too high. (3) Colors of population models from different authors exhibit a substantial range. At solar metallicity and 13 Gyr, this range corresponds to an age error of roughly +/- 7 Gyr. Model colors from different authors applied in a differential sense have smaller uncertainties. (4) In the present models the dominant error for colors is probably the transformation from stellar atmospheric parameters to stellar colors. {\textless}(5) Stellar B - V is difficult to model, and current spreads among different authors can reach 0.2 mag. {\&}(6) If known defects in the stellar flux library are corrected, the population model colors of this work in passbands redder than U would be accurate to roughly 0.03 mag in an absolute sense. These corrections are not made in the tables of model output.},

abstract = {We present the results of a high-resolution, 5 GHz, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array study of the nuclear radio emission in a representative subset of the Atlas3D survey of early-type galaxies (ETGs). We find that 51 +/- 4{\%} of the ETGs in our sample contain nuclear radio emission with luminosities as low as 10{\^{}}18 W/Hz. Most of the nuclear radio sources have compact ({\textless} 25-110 pc) morphologies, although {\textless} 10{\%} display multi-component core+jet or extended jet/lobe structures. Based on the radio continuum properties, as well as optical emission line diagnostics and the nuclear X-ray properties, we conclude that the majority of the central 5 GHz sources detected in the Atlas3D galaxies are associated with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, even at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution, the nuclear radio emission in some cases appears to arise from low-level nuclear star formation rather than an AGN, particularly when molecular gas and a young central stellar population is present. This is in contrast to popular assumptions in the literature that the presence of a compact, unresolved, nuclear radio continuum source universally signifies the presence of an AGN. Additionally, we examine the relationships between the 5 GHz luminosity and various galaxy properties including the molecular gas mass and - for the first time - the global kinematic state. We discuss implications for the growth, triggering, and fueling of radio AGNs, as well as AGN-driven feedback in the continued evolution of nearby ETGs.},

abstract = {We present optical integral field spectroscopy for a flux-limited sample of 19 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) at low redshift (z {\textless} 0.2) and spatially resolve their ionized gas properties at a physical resolution of 2-5 kpc. Extended ionized gas exists in all QSO host galaxies irrespective of their morphological types. The extended narrow-line regions (ENLRs), photoionized by the radiation of active galactic nuclei (AGN), have sizes of up to several kpc and correlate more strongly with the QSO continuum luminosity at 5100 A than with the integrated [O III] luminosity. We find a relation of the form log r {\{}propto{\}} (0.46 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.04)log L5100, reinforcing the picture of an approximately constant ionization parameter for the ionized clouds across the ENLR. Besides the ENLR, we also find gas ionized by young massive stars in more than 50 per cent of the galaxies on kpc scales. In more than half of the sample, the specific star formation rates based on the extinction-corrected H luminosity are consistent with those of inactive disc-dominated galaxies, even for some bulge-dominated QSO hosts. Enhanced star formation rates of up to [{\~{}}]70 M{\{}odot{\}} yr-1 are rare and always associated with signatures of major mergers. Comparison with the star formation rate based on the 60+100 m far-infrared (FIR) luminosity suggests that the FIR luminosity is systematically contaminated by AGN emission and H appears to be a more robust and sensitive tracer for the star formation rate. Evidence for efficient AGN feedback is scarce in our sample, but some of our QSO hosts lack signatures of ongoing star formation leading to a reduced specific star formation rate with respect to the main sequence of galaxies. Whether this is causally linked to the AGN or simply caused by gas depletion remains an open question. Based on 12 QSOs where we can make measurements, we find that on average bulge-dominated QSO host galaxies tend to fall below the mass-metallicity relation compared to their disc-dominated counterparts. While not yet statistically significant for our small sample, this may provide a useful diagnostic for future large surveys if this metal dilution can be shown to be linked to recent or ongoing galaxy interactions.},

@article{Stasinnska1996,
abstract = {We have constructed a grid of models representing an H II region produced by an evolving starburst embedded in a gas cloud of the same metallicity. The models were produced with the spectral energy distribution from a stellar evolutionary synthesis code as input for a photoionization code that computes the emission-line strengths and equivalent widths. Stellar evolution was assumed to proceed according to the models of Maeder. The radiation field was computed using the Kurucz model atmospheres, supplemented by the expanding non-LTE atmospheres of Schmutz et al. for stellar evolutionary phases with strong winds, making a significant improvement over previous works using classical static, plane-parallel model atmospheres. Models for stellar interiors and atmospheres being still in a phase of continuous improvement, our population synthesis models reflect the state of the art in 1995. The models were used to analyze a sample of 100 H II galaxies for which both the H$\beta$ equivalent widths and the [O III] $\lambda$4363 line intensities were available (the latter allowing a direct determination of the oxygen abundances based on measured electron temperatures). Because of these selection criteria, the results of our study are restricted to metal-poor objects with metallicities less than about one-half solar. The confrontation of models with observations is presented in six diagnostic diagrams involving hydrogen and oxygen lines. Our approach is in many respects much more constraining for the models than previous studies on H II regions ionized by evolving starbursts. We found that the standard starburst model (instantaneous burst of star formation with a Salpeter initial mass function and an upper cutoff mass of 100 M☉) reproduces the observational constraints provided by the nebular emission lines extremely well if selection effects are taken into account. Models with a unique initial mass function are consistent with essentially all observational constraints over a metallicity range from {\~{}}0.025 to {\~{}}0.25 Z☉. In contrast, models with a Salpeter-type initial mass function truncated at 50 M☉ are not consistent with the observations: they violate the observed distribution of H$\beta$ equivalent widths. The mean effective temperature of the ionizing star cluster declines from about 50,000 to 40,000 K during the time when the line [0 III] $\lambda$4363 is strong enough to be measurable. Within the framework of our models, and in the abundance range where comparisons were made with observations, there is no significant evidence for a variation of the star cluster mean effective temperature with metallicity, other than the one generated by the metallicity-dependent stellar atmospheric and evolutionary models. A very narrow range in ionization parameters is required to reproduce the observed line ratios. This should set limits on the dynamical evolution of giant H II regions. We find a large fraction of H II galaxies having [O I] $\lambda$6300/H$\beta$ ratios larger than 0.02. Even models with the lowest ionization parameters considered do not produce these large ratios. An approximate estimate of the mechanical energy released by winds and supernovae during later phases of the starburst leads to the suggestion that the [O I] $\lambda$6300/H$\beta$ ratio in contrast to other line ratios studied is significantly affected by shocks. The small spread in the free parameters necessary to reproduce the emission-line properties of metalpoor H II galaxies allows us to propose a new indicator of the starburst age: the [O III] $\lambda$5007 equivalent width is quite robust and can be used up to larger ages than the traditional H$\beta$ equivalent width for high signal-to-noise spectra. This indicator should also prove useful for low signal-to-noise spectra of star-forming galaxies at higher redshift, because of the large value of [O III] $\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ in starbursts younger than 5 Myr.},

abstract = {This review covers age-dating methods applied to young stellar populations in starburst galaxies with ages of 10{\^{}}8 yr and less. First, recent advances in stellar modeling, both for the interior and the atmospheres, are discussed and spectral lines and colors suitable for age-dating are identified. These age indicators are then applied to single stellar populations, the simplest building blocks of starbursts. More complex systems, such as luminous starburst galaxies, are a challenge for chronometric measurements. The dust reddening, metallicity, stellar initial mass function, and inhomogeneities of the interstellar medium introduce degeneracies which are often hard to resolve. Finally, some shortcomings in the stellar models are highlighted.},

abstract = {We investigate the change in ionizing photons in galaxies between 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.6 using the F2 field of the SHELS complete galaxy redshift survey. We show, for the first time, that while the [OIII]/Hb and [OIII]/[OII] ratios rise, the [NII]/H-alpha and [SII]/H-alpha ratios fall significantly over the 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.35 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.2{\textless}log(M/Msun){\textless}10.6. The [OIII]/H-beta and [OIII]/[OII] ratios continue to rise across the full 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.6 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.8{\textless}log(M/Msun){\textless}10.0. We conclusively rule out AGN contamination, a changing ISM pressure, and a change in the hardness of the EUV radiation field as the cause of the change in the line ratios between 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.35. We find that the ionization parameter rises significantly with redshift (by 0.1 to 0.25 dex depending on the stellar mass of the sample). We show that the ionization parameter is strongly correlated with the fraction of young-to-old stars, as traced by the H-beta equivalent width. We discuss the implications of this result on higher redshift studies, and we consider the implications on the use of standard optical metallicity diagnostics at high redshift.},

abstract = {We present HI imaging of the galaxy group IC 1459 carried out with six antennas of the Australian SKA Pathfinder equipped with phased-array feeds. We detect and resolve HI in eleven galaxies down to a column density of {\$}\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}20{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} inside a {\~{}}6 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} field and with a resolution of {\~{}}1 arcmin on the sky and {\~{}}8 km/s in velocity. We present HI images, velocity fields and integrated spectra of all detections, and highlight the discovery of three HI clouds -- two in the proximity of the galaxy IC 5270 and one close to NGC 7418. Each cloud has an HI mass of {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and accounts for {\~{}}15{\%} of the HI associated with its host galaxy. Available images at ultraviolet, optical and infrared wavelengths do not reveal any clear stellar counterpart of any of the clouds, suggesting that they are not gas-rich dwarf neighbours of IC 5270 and NGC 7418. Using Parkes data we find evidence of additional extended, low-column-density HI emission around IC 5270, indicating that the clouds are the tip of the iceberg of a larger system of gas surrounding this galaxy. This result adds to the body of evidence on the presence of intra-group gas within the IC 1459 group. Altogether, the HI found outside galaxies in this group amounts to several times {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, at least 10{\%} of the HI contained inside galaxies. This suggests a substantial flow of gas in and out of galaxies during the several billion years of the group's evolution.},

abstract = {Context: As more and more data are collected by cosmic ray experiments such as the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array (TA), the search for the sources of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) continues. Already we have some hints about the sources or type of sources involved and more work is required to confirm any of this. Aims: We intend to predict the UHECR fluxes and the maximal energies of particles from two complete samples of nearby active galaxies, selected at radio and far-infrared frequencies. Also, we investigate the magnetic scattering of the UHECR path in the intervening cosmic space. Methods: We propose here a new method of searching for the sources of the UHECR in three steps, first we model the activity of the type of sources and get the flux of UHECR and a maximal energy for particle acceleration, then we model the interaction and angle deflection in the intergalactic space and finally we simulate the distribution of the cosmic rays events that can be statistically compared with future data of the cosmic rays observatories. Results: We analyzed two classes of sources, gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and Radio Galaxies (RGs). Ordering by the UHECR flux, few RGs are viable candidates, as for GRB many sources are viable candidates, requiring less scattering of the particles along their path to Earth to interpret the presently observed sky distribution. Most of the flux from RGs comes from the Southern sky, and most of the flux of particles from GRB comes from the North, although the differences are so small as to require large statistics to confirm this. The intergalactic and Galactic magnetic fields may help to distinguish the two extreme cases, also pure protons from heavy nuclei at the same energy. As a consequence flat spectrum radio sources such as 3C279 should confirm the production of UHECR in this class of sources through energetic neutrinos.},

abstract = {We have obtained long-slit spectroscopy for a sample of 9 S0 galaxies in the Fornax Cluster using the FORS2 spectrograph at the 8.2m ESO VLT. From these data, we have extracted the kinematic parameters, comprising the mean velocity, velocity dispersion and higher-moment H3 and H4 coefficients, as a function of position along the major axes of these galaxies. Comparison with published kinematics indicates that earlier data are often limited by their lower signal-to-noise ratio and relatively poor spectral resolution. The greater depth and higher dispersion of the new data mean that we reach well beyond the bulges of these systems, probing their disk kinematics in some detail for the first time. Qualitative inspection of the results for individual galaxies shows that they are not entirely simple systems, perhaps indicating a turbulent past. Nonetheless, we are able to derive reliable circular velocities for most of these systems, which points the way toward a study of their Tully-Fisher relation. This study, along with an analysis of the stellar populations of these systems out to large galactocentric distances, will form the bases of future papers exploiting these new high-quality data, hopefully shedding new light on the evolutionary history of these systems.},

abstract = {We present integral field spectroscopy of 10 early-type galaxies in the nearby, low-mass, Fornax cluster, from which we derive spatially resolved stellar kinematics. Based on the morphologies of their stellar velocity maps we classify 2/10 galaxies as slow rotators, with the remaining eight galaxies fast rotators. Supplementing our integral field observations with morphological and kinematic data from the literature, we analyse the  kinematic' type of all 30 galaxies in the Fornax cluster brighter than MK = -21.5 mag (M* [{\~{}}] 6 {\{}nun{\}}109 M{\{}odot{\}}). Our sample's slow rotator fraction within one virial radius is [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} per cent. [IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} per cent of the early-type galaxies are slow rotators, consistent with the observed fraction in other galaxy aggregates. The fraction of slow rotators in Fornax varies with cluster-centric radius, rising to 16[IMG]f3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} per cent of all kinematic types within the central 0.2 virial radii, from 0 per cent in the cluster outskirts. We find that, even in mass-matched samples of slow and fast rotators, slow rotators are found preferentially at higher projected environmental density than fast rotators. This demonstrates that dynamical friction alone cannot be responsible for the differing distributions of slow and fast rotators. For dynamical friction to play a significant role, slow rotators must reside in higher mass sub-haloes than fast rotators and/or form in the centres of groups before being accreted on to the cluster.},

abstract = {(abridged) The Pierre Auger Collaboration has reported 27 Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray Events (UHECRs) with energies above 56 EeV and well determined arrival directions as of 2007 August 31. They find that the arrival directions are not isotropic, but instead appear correlated with the positions of nearby AGNs. Our aim was to determine the sources of these UHECRs by comparing their arrival directions with more comprehensive source catalogs.   Four (eight) of the 27 UHECRs with energy {\textgreater}56EeV detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory have arrival directions within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of the extended ({\textgreater}180kpc) radio structures of nearby radiogalaxies or the single nearby BLLac with extended radio structure. Conversely the radio structures of three (six) of all ten nearest extended radiogalaxies are within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of a UHECR; three of the remaining four radiogalaxies are in directions with lower exposure times. This correlation between nearby extended radiogalaxies and a subset of UHECRs is significant at the 99.9{\%} level. This is the first direct observational proof that radio galaxies are a significant source of UHECRs. For the remaining {\~{}}20 UHECRs, an isotropic distribution cannot be ruled out at high significance. The correlation found by the Auger Collaboration between the 27 UHECRs and AGNs in the Veron-Cetty {\&} Veron catalog at D {\textless} 71Mpc has a much lower significance when one considers only the {\~{}}20 UHECRs not `matched' to nearby extended radiogalaxies. No correlation is seen between UHECRs and supernovae, supernova remnants, nearby galaxies, or nearby groups and clusters of galaxies. The primary difference between the UHECR detections at the Pierre Auger Observatory and previous experiments may thus be that the Southern Hemisphere is more privileged with respect to nearby extended radiogalaxies.},

abstract = {We present results from Chandra X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of flat spectrum radio-emitting quasars with jet-like extended structure. Twelve of twenty quasar jets are detected in 5 ks ACIS-S exposures. The quasars without X-ray jets are not significantly different from those in the sample with detected jets except that the extended radio emission is generally fainter. New radio maps are combined with the X-ray images in order to elucidate the relation between radio and X-ray emission in spatially resolved structures. We find a variety of morphologies, including long straight jets and bends up to 90 degrees. All X-ray jets are one-sided although the radio images used for source selection often show lobes opposite the X-ray jets. The FR II X-ray jets can all be interpreted as inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by electrons in large-scale relativistic jets although deeper observations are required to test this interpretation in detail. Applying this interpretation to the jets as a population, we find that the jets would be aligned to within 30 degrees of the line of sight generally, assuming that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jets is 10.},

abstract = {This paper is the third one in a series, intended to investigate how the observed kinematics of elliptical galaxies are affected by dust attenuation. In Paper I and Paper II, we investigated the effects of dust absorption; here we extend our modelling in order to include the effects of scattering. We describe how kinematical information can be combined with the radiative transfer equation, and present a Monte Carlo code that can handle kinematical information in an elegant way.   Compared to the case where only absorption is taken into account, we find that dust attenuation considerably affects the observed kinematics when scattering is included. For the central lines of sight, dust can either decrease or increase the central observed velocity dispersion. The most important effect of dust attenuation, however, is found at large projected radii. The kinematics at these lines of sight are strongly affected by photons scattered into these lines of sight, which were emitted by high-velocity stars in the central regions of the galaxy. These photons bias the LOSVDs towards high line-of-sight velocities, and significantly increase the observed velocity dispersion and LOSVD shape parameters. These effects are similar to the expected kinematical signature of a dark matter halo, such that dust attenuation may form an alternative explanation for the usual stellar kinematical evidence for dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies.   We apply our results to discuss several other topics in galactic dynamics, where we feel dust attenuation should be taken into account. In particular, we argue that the kinematics observed at various wavelengths can help to constrain the spatial distribution of dust in elliptical galaxies.},

abstract = {(Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies [(U)LIRGs] are much more numerous at cosmological distances than locally, and are likely precursors of elliptical galaxies. Our goal is to carry out an integral field spectroscopic survey of a representative sample of low redshift (z {\textless} 0.26) (U)LIRGs, covering different morphologies from spirals to mergers over the entire infrared luminosity range. The present study is based on optical IFS obtained with the VIMOS instrument on the VLT. The first results of this survey are presented here with the study of two galaxies representative of the two major morphological types observed in (U)LIRGs, interacting pairs and morphologically- regular, weakly-interacting spirals, respectively. We have found that IRAS 06076-2139 consists of two low-intermediate mass (0.15 and 0.4 m*) galaxies with relative velocities of {\~{}} 550 km/s and, therefore, it is unlikely that they will merge. The VIMOS IFS has also discovered the presence of a rapidly expanding and rotating ring of gas in the southern galaxy (Gs), likely due to a nearly central head-on passage of an intruder about 140 million years ago. IRASF 12115-4656 is a spiral for which we have found a mass of 1.2 m*. The neutral gas (traced by the NaI doublet) and ionized gas components are spatially and kinematically decoupled. The analysis presented here illustrates the full potential of IFS in two important aspects: (i) the study of the kinematics and ionization structure of complex interacting/merging systems, and (2i) the study of the kinematics of the different gas phases, neutral (cool) and ionized (warm), traced by the NaD and Halpha lines, respectively.

Continuum and background subtracted emission line maps in the light of [O III] 5007, H-alpha, and [N II] 6584 are presented. Both galaxies display signs of ongoing perturbation and/or interaction. UM 420 is resolved for the first time to be a merging system composed of two starbursting components with an 'arm-like' structure associated with the largest component. UM 462 which is a disrupted system of irregular morphology is resolved into at least four starbursting regions. Maps of the H-alpha radial velocity and FWHM are discussed. No underlying broad line region was detected from either galaxy as the emission lines are well-fitted with single Gaussian profiles only. Electron temperatures and densities as well as the abundances of helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur were computed from spectra integrated over the whole galaxies and for each area of recent star formation. Maps of the O/H ratio are presented: these galaxies show oxygen abundances that are {\~{}}20 per cent solar. No evidence of substantial abundance variations across the galaxies that would point to significant nitrogen or oxygen self-enrichment is found ({\textless}0.2 dex limit). Contrary to previous observations, this analysis does not support the classification of these BCGs as Wolf-Rayet galaxies as the characteristic broad emission line features have not been detected in our spectra. Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich emission line ratio diagrams which were constructed on a pixel by pixel basis indicate that the optical spectra of these systems are predominantly excited by stellar photoionization.},

abstract = {We present deep Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 imaging in the rest-frame optical for a sample of eight galaxies at z {\~{}} 1.5 with high photometrically determined stellar masses. The data are combined with five Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter spectra. We find that these 13 galaxies have high velocity dispersions, with a median of $\sigma$ = 301 km s-1. This high value is consistent with their relatively high stellar masses and compact sizes. We study their stellar populations using the strength of Balmer absorption lines, which are not sensitive to dust absorption. We find a large range in Balmer absorption strength, with many galaxies showing very strong lines indicating young ages. The median H$\delta$A equivalent width, determined directly or inferred from the H10 line, is 5.4 {\AA}, indicating a luminosity-weighted age of {\~{}}1 Gyr. Although this value may be biased toward higher values because of selection effects, high-dispersion galaxies with such young ages are extremely rare in the local universe. Interestingly, we do not find a simple correlation with rest-frame U - V color: some of the reddest galaxies have very strong Balmer absorption lines, which may indicate the importance of multiple bursts of star formation. These results demonstrate that many high-dispersion galaxies at z {\~{}} 1.5 were recently quenched. This implies that there must be a population of star-forming progenitors at z {\~{}} 2 with high velocity dispersions or linewidths, which are notoriously absent from CO/H$\alpha$ selected surveys.},

We combine these measurements to infer velocity dispersions and determine how the number density of galaxies at fixed inferred dispersion, or the velocity dispersion function (VDF), evolves with time for each population. We show that the number of galaxies with high velocity dispersions appears to be surprisingly stable with time, regardless of their star formation history. Furthermore, the overall VDF for star-forming galaxies is constant with redshift, extending down to the lowest velocity dispersions probed by this study. The only galaxy population showing strong evolution are quiescent galaxies with low inferred dispersions, whose number density increases by a factor of {\~{}}4 since z = 1.5. This buildup leads to an evolution in the quiescent fraction of galaxies such that the threshold dispersion above which quiescent galaxies dominate the counts moves to lower velocity dispersion with time. We show that our results are qualitatively consistent with a simple model in which star-forming galaxies quench and are added to the quiescent population. In order to compensate for the migration into the quiescent population, the velocity dispersions of star-forming galaxies must increase, with a rate that increases with dispersion.},

abstract = {Observations of galaxy isophotes, longs-slit kinematics and high-resolution photometry suggested a possible dichotomy between two distinct classes of E galaxies. But these methods are expensive for large galaxy samples. Instead, integral-field spectroscopic can efficiently recognize the shape, dynamics and stellar population of complete samples of early-type galaxies (ETGs). These studies showed that the two main classes, the fast and slow rotators, can be separated using stellar kinematics. We showed there is a dichotomy in the dynamics of the two classes. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial and dominate above {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm crit{\}}\backslashapprox2\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. Below {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm crit{\}}{\$}, the structure of fast rotators parallels that of spiral galaxies. There is a smooth sequence along which, the metals content, the enhancement in {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-elements, and the "weight" of the stellar initial mass function, all increase with the CENTRAL mass density slope, or bulge mass fraction, while the molecular gas fraction correspondingly decreases. The properties of ETGs on galaxy scaling relations, and in particular the {\$}(M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}, R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm e{\}}){\$} diagram, and their dependence on environment, indicate two main independent channels for galaxy evolution. Fast rotators ETGs start as star forming disks and evolve trough a channel dominated by gas accretion, bulge growth and quenching. While slow rotators assemble near the center of massive halos via intense star formation at high redshift, and remain as such for the rest of their evolution via a channel dominated by gas poor mergers. This is consistent with independent studies of the galaxies redshift evolution.},

Recent studies on the local low-luminosity radio sources cast lights on an emerging population of compact radio galaxies which lack extended radio emission. In a pilot JVLA project, we study the high-resolution images of a small but representative sample of this population. The radio maps reveal compact unresolved or slightly resolved radio structures on a scale of 1-3 kpc. We find that these RL AGN live in red massive early-type galaxies, with large black hole masses ({\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}8{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}), and spectroscopically classified as Low Excitation Galaxies, all characteristics typical of FRI radio galaxies which they also share the same nuclear luminosity with.

We call these sources 'FR0' to emphasize their lack of prominent extended radio emission. A posteriori, other compact radio sources found in the literature fulfill the requirements for a FR0 classification. Hence, the emerging FR0 population appears to be the dominant radio class of the local Universe. Considering their properties we speculate on their possible origins and the possible cosmological scenarios they imply.},

These MASSIVE ETGs seem to have lower star-formation efficiencies (SFE=SFR/M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm H2{\}}{\$}) than spiral galaxies, but the SFEs derived are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution found in other lower mass ETG samples. This suggests that the SFE is not simply a function of stellar mass, but that local, internal processes are more important for regulating star formation. Finally we used the CO line profiles to investigate the high-mass end of the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR). We find that there is a break in the slope of the TFR for ETGs at high masses (consistent with previous studies). The strength of this break correlates with the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, suggesting it is caused by additional baryonic mass being present in the centre of massive ETGs. We speculate on the root cause of this change and its implications for galaxy formation theories.},

abstract = {Context. Powerful radio-AGN are hosted by massive elliptical galaxies that are usually very poor in molecular gas. Nevertheless, gas is needed at their very center to feed the nuclear activity.  Aims: We study the molecular gas properties (i.e., mass, kinematics, distribution, origin) of these objects, and compare them with results for other known samples.  Methods: At the IRAM-30m telescope, we performed a survey of the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission from the most powerful radio galaxies of the Local Universe, selected only on the basis of their radio continuum fluxes.  Results: The main result of our survey is that the molecular gas content of these galaxies is very low compared to spiral or FIR-selected galaxies. The median value of the molecular gas mass, including detections and upper limits, is 2.2 × 108 M⊙. When separated into FR-I and FR-II types, a difference in their H2 masses is found. The median value of FR-I galaxies is about 1.9 × 108 M⊙ and higher for FR-II galaxies, at about 4.5 × 108 M⊙. Which is probably entirely because of a Malmquist bias. Our results contrast with those of previous surveys, whose targets were mainly selected by means of their FIR emission, implying that we measure higher observed masses of molecular gas. Moreover, the shape of CO spectra suggest that a central molecular gas disk exists in 30{\%} of these radio galaxies, a lower rate than in other active galaxy samples.  Conclusions: We find a low level of molecular gas in our sample of radio-selected AGNs, indicating that galaxies do not need much molecular gas to host an AGN. The presence of a molecular gas disk in some galaxies and the wide range of molecular gas masses may be indicative of different origins for the gas, which we can not exclude at present (e.g., minor/major mergers, stellar mass loss, or accretion).

We reason that if their gas originates from the mergers of two gas-rich disk galaxies, as has been invoked to explain the molecular gas in other radio galaxies, then these galaxies must have merged a long time ago (few Gyr or more) but their remnant elliptical galaxies only recently (last 10{\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\^{}}{\}}7{\{}{\$}{\}} years or less) become active radio galaxies. Instead, we argue the the cannibalism of gas-rich galaxies provide a simpler explanation for the origin of molecular gas in the elliptical hosts of radio galaxies (Lim et al. 2000).

abstract = {Aperture synthesis observations of 12CO(J=1-0) emissions of the radio galaxy 3C 31 (NGC 383) have been made using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA) and the RAINBOW interferometer (NMA plus the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope). Our high-resolution (1.9"×1.4", or 640pc×470pc, at D=70 Mpc) 12CO image shows a circularly rotating molecular gas disk that closely coincides with a silhouette disk observed in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical images. The molecular gas mass (Mgas) of the disk is estimated to be 9.7×108Msolar within a radius of 1 kpc, and the peak gas surface density $\Sigma$gas is 4.0×102Msolar pc-2 at 440 pc from the center, if a Galactic I(CO)-to-N(H2) conversion factor (1.8×1020 cm-2 [K km s-1]-1) is applied. The rotation velocity of the disk is 460 km s-1 at a radius of 1 kpc, giving an enclosed mass (dynamical mass) of Mdyn=5.0×1010Msolar within this radius. The ratio of gas mass to dynamical mass, Mgas/Mdyn, is less than 0.02, indicating that the gas disk at the center of 3C 31 is stable against gravitational instabilities, although the total gas mass of the nuclear disk in 3C 31 is fairly large compared with the nuclear gas concentration observed in late-type spirals.},

abstract = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations induced by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) during major mergers of spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment of accretion onto supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers nuclear gas inflow, which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale, particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of the remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black holes. Without AGNs, gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that remain blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyr have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes produce elliptical galaxies that redden much faster, an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r{\~{}}=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population of extremely red massive early-type galaxies, and it appears to be an important driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the local universe.},

abstract = {Almost 60{\%} of the B2 low luminosity radio galaxies have been observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. We present an analysis of the dust features, which are often present in the form of circum-nuclear disks or lanes, and show that there are correlations between radio source and dust properties. It is found that nearby radio sources in which a jet has been detected tend to have dust more often than sources without jets; the dust is often in the form of disks or lanes. Moreover the radio jets are close to perpendicular to the disk or lane in the weaker radio sources (with P {\textless} 1024 WHz-1). In stronger sources the orientation effect appears to be weak or even absent. Also the dust masses found in the weaker radio sources are smaller than in the stronger ones (log M/Msun  {\~{}} 3 against 5 respectively). More generally it appears that there is a correlation between dust mass and total radio power (for those sources in which dust has been detected); we show that this correlation is not induced by redshift.

We find that the rest-frame color distribution of these galaxies is bimodal at all redshifts out to z{\~{}}1. This bimodality permits a model-independent definition of red early-type galaxies and blue late-type galaxies at any given redshift. The colors of the blue peak become redder toward the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has dropped strongly since z{\~{}}1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they populate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in galaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over this redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color of the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent with the aging of an ancient stellar population. The rest-frame B-band luminosity density in red galaxies evolves only mildly with redshift in a $\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter universe. When we account for the change in stellar mass-to-light ratio implied by the redshift evolution in red galaxy colors, the COMBO-17 data indicate an increase in stellar mass on the red sequence by a factor of 2 since z{\~{}}1. The largest source of uncertainty is large-scale structure, implying that considerably larger surveys are necessary to further refine this result. We explore mechanisms that may drive this evolution in the red galaxy population, finding that both galaxy merging and truncation of star formation in some fraction of the blue star-forming population are required to fully explain the properties of these galaxies.},

abstract = {[Abridged] Detecting cosmic ray hits (cosmics) in fiber-fed IFS data of single exposures is a challenging task, because of the complex signal recorded by IFS instruments. Existing detection algorithms are commonly found to be unreliable in the case of IFS data and the optimal parameter settings are usually unknown a-priori for a given dataset. The CALIFA survey generates hundreds of IFS datasets for which a reliable and robust detection algorithm for cosmics is required as an important part of the fully automatic CALIFA data reduction pipeline. We developed a novel algorithm, PyCosmic, which combines the edge-detection algorithm of L.A.Cosmic with a point-spread function convolution scheme. We generated mock data to compute the efficiency of different algorithms for a wide range of characteristic fibre-fed IFS datasets using the PMAS and VIMOS IFS instruments as representative cases. PyCosmic is the only algorithm that achieves an acceptable detection performance for CALIFA data. We find that PyCosmic is the most robust tool with a detection rate of {\textgreater}{\~{}}90{\%} and a false detection rate {\textless}5{\%} for any of the tested IFS data. It has one less free parameter than the L.A.Cosmic algorithm. Only for strongly undersampled IFS data does L.A.Cosmic exceed the performance of PyCosmic by a few per cent. DCR never reaches the efficiency of the other two algorithms and should only be used if computational speed is a concern. Thus, PyCosmic appears to be the most versatile cosmics detection algorithm for IFS data. It is implemented in the new CALIFA data reduction pipeline as well as in recent versions of the multi-instrument IFS pipeline P3D.},

New Hubble Space Telescope imaging of far-ultraviolet continuum emission from young ([lsim]10 Myr), massive ({\{}gtrsim{\}}5 M{\{}odot{\}}) stars reveals filamentary and clumpy morphologies, which we quantify by means of structural indices. The FUV data are compared with X-ray, Ly, narrow-band H, broad-band optical/IR, and radio maps, providing a high spatial resolution atlas of star formation locales relative to the ambient hot ([{\~{}}]107-8 K) and warm ionized ([{\~{}}]104 K) gas phases, as well as the old stellar population and radio-bright active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows. Nearly half of the sample possesses kpc-scale filaments that, in projection, extend towards and around radio lobes and/or X-ray cavities. These filaments may have been uplifted by the propagating jet or buoyant X-ray bubble, or may have formed in situ by cloud collapse at the interface of a radio lobe or rapid cooling in a cavity's compressed shell. The morphological diversity of nearly the entire FUV sample is reproduced by recent hydrodynamical simulations in which the AGN powers a self-regulating rain of thermally unstable star-forming clouds that precipitate from the hot atmosphere. In this model, precipitation triggers where the cooling-to-free-fall time ratio is tcool/tff [{\~{}}] 10. This condition is roughly met at the maximal projected FUV radius for more than half of our sample, and clustering about this ratio is stronger for sources with higher star formation rates.},

abstract = {Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are usually quiescent, but many exhibit star formation. Here we exploit the opportunity provided by rest-frame UV imaging of galaxy clusters in the Cluster Lensing and Supernovae with Hubble (CLASH) Multi-Cycle Treasury Project to reveal the diversity of UV morphologies in BCGs and to compare them with recent simulations of the cool, star-forming gas structures produced by precipitation-driven feedback. All of the CLASH BCGs are detected in the rest-frame UV (280 nm), regardless of their star formation activity, because evolved stellar populations produce a modest amount of UV light that traces the relatively smooth, symmetric, and centrally peaked stellar distribution seen in the near infrared. Ultraviolet morphologies among the BCGs with strong UV excesses exhibit distinctive knots, multiple elongated clumps, and extended filaments of emission that distinctly differ from the smooth profiles of the UV-quiet BCGs. These structures, which are similar to those seen in the few star-forming BCGs observed in the UV at low redshift, are suggestive of bi-polar streams of clumpy star formation, but not of spiral arms or large, kiloparsec-scale disks. Based on the number of streams and lack of culprit companion galaxies, these streams are unlikely to have arisen from multiple collisions with gas-rich galaxies. These star-forming UV structures are morphologically similar to the cold-gas structures produced in simulations of precipitation-driven active galactic nucleus feedback in which jets uplift low-entropy gas to greater altitudes, causing it to condense. Unobscured star formation rates estimated from CLASH UV images using the Kennicutt relation range up to 80  in the most extended and highly structured systems. The circumgalactic gas-entropy threshold for star formation in CLASH BCGs at  0.2–0.5 is indistinguishable from that for clusters at .},

Equations governing stationary force-free electromagnetic fields in Kerr spacetime are derived, and it is found that energy and angular momentum can be extracted from a rotating black hole by a purely electromagnetic mechanism. A perturbation technique is outlined for calculating approximate solutions under certain circumstances, and solutions are obtained for a split monopole magnetic field as well as for a paraboloidal magnetic field.

abstract = {Aims: We present photometric properties and distance measurements of 252 high redshift Type Ia supernovae (0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.1) discovered during the first three years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). These events were detected and their multi-colour light curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshifts.  Methods: Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve modeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak magnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a precise calibration of the SNLS fields.  Results: A flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological fit to 231 SNLS high redshift type Ia supernovae alone gives $\Omega${\_}M = 0.211 ± 0.034(stat) ± 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from light curve fitters come next with a total contribution of ±0.026 on $\Omega${\_}M. No clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope ($\beta$) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.  Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.

abstract = {The ATLAS3D project is a multiwavelength survey combined with a theoretical modelling effort. The observations span from the radio to the millimetre and optical, and provide multicolour imaging, two-dimensional kinematics of the atomic (H I), molecular (CO) and ionized gas (H$\beta$, [O III] and [N I]), together with the kinematics and population of the stars (H$\beta$, Fe5015 and Mg b), for a carefully selected, volume-limited (1.16 × 105 Mpc3) sample of 260 early-type (elliptical E and lenticular S0) galaxies (ETGs). The models include semi-analytic, N-body binary mergers and cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here we present the science goals for the project and introduce the galaxy sample and the selection criteria. The sample consists of nearby (D {\textless} 42 Mpc, |$\delta$- 29°| {\textless} 35°, |b| {\textgreater} 15°) morphologically selected ETGs extracted from a parent sample of 871 galaxies (8 per cent E, 22 per cent S0 and 70 per cent spirals) brighter than MK {\textless} -21.5 mag (stellar mass M★≳ 6 ×109 M⊙). We analyse possible selection biases and we conclude that the parent sample is essentially complete and statistically representative of the nearby galaxy population. We present the size-luminosity relation for the spirals and ETGs and show that the ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample define a tight red sequence in a colour-magnitude diagram, with few objects in the transition from the blue cloud. We describe the strategy of the SAURON integral field observations and the extraction of the stellar kinematics with the pPXF method. We find typical 1$\sigma$ errors of $\Delta$V≈ 6 km s-1, $\Delta$$\sigma$≈ 7 km s-1, $\Delta$h3≈$\Delta$h4≈ 0.03 in the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion and Gauss-Hermite (GH) moments for galaxies with effective dispersion $\sigma$e≳ 120 km s-1. For galaxies with lower $\sigma$e (≈40 per cent of the sample) the GH moments are gradually penalized by pPXF towards zero to suppress the noise produced by the spectral undersampling and only V and $\sigma$ can be measured. We give an overview of the characteristics of the other main data sets already available for our sample and of the ongoing modelling projects.},

abstract = {We provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within one effective radius of a volume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the nearby Universe, using the integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the ATLAS3D project. We exploit the $\lambda$R parameter (previously used via a constant threshold value of 0.1) to characterize the existence of two families of ETGs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fields and often include stellar kinematically distinct cores, and fast rotators which have regular velocity fields. Our complete sample of 260 ETGs leads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which now includes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity ɛ. It separates the two classes significantly better than the previous prescription and better than a criterion based on V/$\sigma$: slow rotators and fast rotators have $\lambda$R lower and larger than ?, respectively, where kFS= 0.31 for measurements made within an effective radius Re.  We show that the vast majority of ETGs are fast rotators: these have the regular stellar rotation, with aligned photometric and kinematic axes (Paper II of this series), include discs and often bars and represent 86 ± 2 per cent (224/260) of all ETGs in the volume-limited ATLAS3D sample. Fast rotators span the full range of apparent ellipticities from ɛ= 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsic ellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologies consistent with spiral galaxies. Only a small fraction of ETGs are slow rotators representing 14 ± 2 per cent (36/260) of the ATLAS3D sample of ETGs. Of all slow rotators, 11 per cent (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like components and are rather low-mass objects (Mdyn {\textless} 1010.5 M⊙). All other slow rotators (32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (ɛe {\textless} 0.4), tend to be massive (Mdyn {\textgreater} 1010.5 M⊙), and often (17/32) exhibit kinematically distinct cores. Slow rotators dominate the high-mass end of ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample, with only about one-fourth of galaxies with masses above 1011.5 M⊙ being fast rotators. We show that the a4 parameter which quantifies the isophote's disciness or boxiness does not seem to be simply related to the observed kinematics, while our new criterion based on $\lambda$R and ɛ is nearly independent of the viewing angles. We further demonstrate that the classification of ETGs into ellipticals and lenticulars is misleading. Slow and fast rotators tend to be classified as ellipticals and lenticulars, respectively, but the contamination is strong enough to affect results solely based on such a scheme: 20 per cent of all fast rotators are classified as ellipticals, and more importantly 66 per cent of all ellipticals in the ATLAS3D sample are fast rotators.  Fast and slow rotators illustrate the variety of complex processes shaping galactic systems, such as secular evolution, disc instabilities, interaction and merging, gas accretion, stripping and harassment, forming a sequence from high to low (stellar) baryonic angular momentum. Massive slow rotators represent the extreme instances within the red sequence of galaxies which might have suffered from significant merging without being able to rebuild a fast-rotating component within one effective radius. We therefore argue for a shift in the paradigm for ETGs, where the vast majority of ETGs are galaxies consistent with nearly oblate systems (with or without bars) and where only a small fraction of them (less than 12 per cent) have central (mildly) triaxial structures.},

abstract = {We have carried out a survey for CO J= 1-0 and J= 2-1 emission in the 260 early-type galaxies of the volume-limited ATLAS3D sample, with the goal of connecting their star formation and assembly histories to their cold gas content. This is the largest volume-limited CO survey of its kind and is the first to include many Virgo cluster members. Sample members are dynamically hot galaxies with a median stellar mass ˜3 × 1010 M⊙; they are selected by their morphology rather than colour, and the bulk of them lie on the red sequence. The overall CO detection rate is 56/259 = 0.22 ± 0.03, with no dependence on the K luminosity and only a modest dependence on the dynamical mass. There are a dozen CO detections among the Virgo cluster members; statistical analysis of their H2 mass distributions and their dynamical status within the cluster shows that the cluster's influence on their molecular masses is subtle at best, even though (unlike spirals) they seem to be virialized within the cluster. We suggest that the cluster members have retained their molecular gas through several Gyr residences in the cluster. There are also a few extremely CO-rich early-type galaxies with H2 masses ≳109 M⊙ and these are in low-density environments. We do find a significant trend between the molecular content and stellar specific angular momentum. The galaxies of low angular momentum also have low CO detection rates, suggesting that their formation processes were more effective at destroying the molecular gas or preventing its re-accretion. We speculate on the implications of these data for the formation of various subclasses of early-type galaxies. Based on observations carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope. The IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany) and IGN (Spain).},

abstract = {We demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observations that CO molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-mass galaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the CO Tully-Fisher relation (CO-TFR) of early-type galaxies. We compare the TFRs produced using both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclination estimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as a criterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond the peak of the rotation curve. We show that the gradient and zero-point of the best-fitting relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure and inclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellar kinematics. We also show that the early-type CO-TFR is offset from the CO-TFR of spirals by 0.98 ± 0.22 mag at Ks band, in line with other results. The intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be ≈0.4 mag, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxy population. Next-generation facilities such as the Large Millimeter Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array should allow this technique to be used in higher redshift systems, providing a simple new tool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxies over cosmic time.},

abstract = {We use the ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies to study the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, $\Psi$, defined as the angle between the photometric and kinematic major axes. We find that 71 per cent of nearby early-type galaxies are strictly aligned systems ($\Psi$≤ 5°), an additional 14 per cent have 5° {\textless} $\Psi$≤ 10° and 90 per cent of galaxies have $\Psi$≤ 15°. Taking into account measurement uncertainties, 90 per cent of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5°, suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (˜10 per cent) are not consistent with the axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. We identify morphological features such as bars and rings (30 per cent), dust structures (16 per cent), blue nuclear colours (6 per cent) and evidence of interactions (8 per cent) visible on ATLAS3D galaxies. We use KINEMETRY to analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies into two broad types of regular and non-regular rotators. We find 82 per cent of regular rotators and 17 per cent of non-regular rotators, with two galaxies that we were not able to classify due to the poor data quality. The non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions and are massive. We characterize the specific features in the mean velocity and velocity dispersion maps. The majority of galaxies do not have any specific features, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinct cores (7 per cent of galaxies) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4 per cent of galaxies). We separate galaxies into five kinematic groups based on the kinemetric features, which are then used to interpret the ($\Psi$-ɛ) diagram. Most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and are non-regular rotators. In addition, some show evidence of the interaction and might not be in equilibrium, while some are barred. While the trends are weak, there is a tendency that large values of $\Psi$ are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities and among the most massive galaxies in the sample. Taking into account the kinematic alignment and the kinemetric analysis, the majority of early-type galaxies have velocity maps more similar to that of the spiral discs than to that of the remnants of equal-mass mergers. We suggest that the most common formation mechanism for early-type galaxies preserves the axisymmetry of the disc progenitors and their general kinematic properties. Less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with much lower net angular momentum.},

abstract = {We study the formation of early-type galaxies (ETGs) through mergers with a sample of 70 high-resolution (softening length {\textless}60 pc and 12 × 106 particles) numerical simulations of binary mergers of disc galaxies (with 10 per cent of gas) and 16 simulations of ETG remergers. These simulations, designed to accompany observations and models conducted within the ATLAS3D project, encompass various mass ratios (from 1:1 to 6:1), initial conditions and orbital parameters. The progenitor disc galaxies are spiral-like with bulge-to-disc ratios typical of Sb and Sc galaxies and high central baryonic angular momentum. We find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1 and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators according to the ATLAS3D criterion (based on the $\lambda$R parameter - ATLAS3D Paper III): they preserve the structure of the input fast rotating spiral progenitors. They have intrinsic ellipticities larger than 0.5, cover intrinsic $\lambda$R values between 0.2 and 0.6, within the range of observed fast rotators. The distribution of the observed fastest rotators does in fact coincide with the distribution of our disc progenitors. Major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1) lead to both fast and slow rotators. Most of the fast rotators produced in major mergers have intermediate flattening, with ellipticities ɛ between 0.4 and 0.6. Most slow rotators formed in these binary disc mergers hold a stellar kinematically distinct core (KDC) in their ˜1-3 central kiloparsec: these KDCs are built from the stellar components of the progenitors. However, these remnants are still very flat with ɛ often larger than 0.45 and sometimes as high as 0.65. Besides a handful of specific observed systems - the counter-rotating discs (2$\sigma$ galaxies, ATLAS3D Paper II) - these therefore cannot reproduce the observed population of slow rotators in the nearby Universe. This sample of simulations supports the notion of slow and fast rotators: these two families of ETGs present distinct characteristics in term of their angular momentum content (at all radii) and intrinsic properties - the slow rotators are not simply velocity-scaled down versions of fast rotators. The mass ratio of the progenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators in these binary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the earlier-type (Sb) progenitor galaxy with respect to the orbital angular momentum. We also study remergers of these merger remnants: these produce relatively round fast rotators or systems near the threshold for slow rotators. In such cases, the orbital angular momentum dominates the central region, and these systems no longer exhibit a KDC, as KDCs are destroyed during the remergers and do not re-form in these relatively dry events.},

abstract = {In Paper I of this series we introduced a volume-limited parent sample of 871 galaxies from which we extracted the ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs). In Papers II and III we classified the ETGs using their stellar kinematics, in a way that is nearly insensitive to the projection effects, and we separated them into fast and slow rotators. Here we look at galaxy morphology and note that the edge-on fast rotators generally are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies with the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals (E5 or flatter) with discy isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of bulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder (E4 or rounder, except for counter-rotating discs) and are generally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical galaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it gives a misleading description of ETGs by ignoring the large variation in the bulge sizes of fast rotators. Motivated by the fact that only one third (34 per cent) of the ellipticals in our sample are slow rotators, we study for the first time the kinematic morphology-density T-$\Sigma$ relation using fast and slow rotators to replace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than using classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density environments [? per cent] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR) ≈ 4 per cent] of the total galaxy population in the relatively low-density environments explored by our survey, with the exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR) ≈ 20 per cent]. This contrasts with the classic studies that invariably find significant fractions of (misclassified) ellipticals down to the lowest environmental densities. We find a clean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the local galaxy surface density $\Sigma$3, within a cylinder enclosing the three nearest galaxies. This holds for nearly four orders of magnitude in the surface density down to $\Sigma$3≈ 0.01 Mpc-2, with f(Sp) decreasing by 10 per cent per dex in $\Sigma$3, while f(FR) correspondingly increases. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-$\Sigma$ relation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment, like e.g. ram-pressure stripping, as main contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast rotators in low-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local effects at the small-group scale. This is supported by the relation becoming shallower when using a surface density estimator $\Sigma$10 with a cluster scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo core does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepen sharply, while the fraction of slow rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that a different mechanism is at work there, possibly related to the stripping of the gas from spirals by the hot intergalactic medium in the cluster core and the corresponding lack of cold accretion.},

abstract = {We propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies (ETG) within the hierarchical $\Lambda$cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario, that is based on the assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in ETGs is a proxy for the specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda$R. Within our model we reproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude in the ATLAS3D survey, assuming that fast-rotating ETGs have at least 10 per cent of their total stellar mass in a disc component. In agreement with ATLAS3D observations we find that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with M* {\textgreater} 1010.5 M⊙ contributing ˜20 per cent to the overall ETG population. We show in detail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different, supporting the classification of ETGs into these two categories. Slow rotators accrete between ˜50 and 90 per cent of their stellar mass from satellites and their most massive progenitors have on average up to three major mergers during their evolution. Fast rotators in contrast accrete less than 50 per cent and have on average less than one major merger in their past.  We find that the underlying physical reason for the different growth histories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas cooling in massive galaxies. Once cooling and associated star formation in disc stop, galaxies grow via infall from satellites. Frequent minor mergers thereby destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lower the specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda$R into the slow rotator regime.  On average, the last gas-rich major merger interaction in slow rotators happens at z {\textgreater} 1.5, followed by a series of minor mergers. These results support the idea that kinematically decoupled cores (KDC) form during gas-rich major mergers at high z followed by minor mergers, which build-up the outer layers of the remnant, and make remnants that are initially too flat compared to observations become rounder. Fast rotators are less likely to form such KDCs due to the fact that they have on average less than one major merger in their past.  Fast rotators in our model have different formation paths. The majority, 78 per cent, has bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios (B/T) {\textgreater} 0.5 and managed to grow stellar discs due to continued gas cooling or bulges due to frequent minor mergers. The remaining 22 per cent live in high-density environments and consist of low B/T galaxies with gas fractions below 15 per cent, that have exhausted their cold gas reservoir and have no hot halo from which gas can cool. These fast rotators most likely resemble the flattened disc-like fast rotators in the ATLAS3D survey.  Our results predict that ETGs can change their state from fast to slow rotator and vice versa, while the former is taking place predominantly at low z (z {\textless} 2), the latter is occurring during cosmic epochs when cooling times are short and galaxies gas-rich. We predict that the ratio of the number density of slow to fast rotators is a strong function of redshift, with massive ({\textgreater}1010 M⊙) fast rotators being more than one order of magnitude more frequent at z˜ 2.},

abstract = {The mass assembly of galaxies leaves imprints in their outskirts, such as shells and tidal tails. The frequency and properties of such fine structures depend on the main acting mechanisms - secular evolution, minor or major mergers - and on the age of the last substantial accretion event. We use this to constrain the mass assembly history of two apparently relaxed nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs) selected from the ATLAS3D sample, NGC 680 and 5557. Our ultra-deep optical images obtained with MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope reach 29 mag  arcsec-2 in the g band. They reveal very low surface brightness (LSB) filamentary structures around these ellipticals. Among them, a gigantic 160 kpc long, narrow, tail east of NGC 5557 hosts three gas-rich star-forming objects, previously detected in H I with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and in UV with GALEX. NGC 680 exhibits two major diffuse plumes apparently connected to extended H I tails, as well as a series of arcs and shells. Comparing the outer stellar and gaseous morphology of the two ellipticals with that predicted from models of colliding galaxies, we argue that the LSB features are tidal debris and that each of these two ETGs was assembled during a relatively recent, major wet merger, which most likely occurred after the redshift z ≃ 0.5 epoch. Had these mergers been older, the tidal features should have already fallen back or be destroyed by more recent accretion events. However, the absence of molecular gas and of a prominent young stellar population in the core region of the galaxies indicates that the merger is at least 1-2 Gyr old: the memory of any merger-triggered nuclear starburst has indeed been lost. The star-forming objects found towards the collisional debris of NGC 5557 are then likely tidal dwarf galaxies. Such recycled galaxies here appear to be long-lived and continue to form stars while any star formation activity has stopped in their parent galaxy. The inner kinematics of NGC 680 is typical for fast rotators which make the bulk of nearby ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample. On the other hand, NGC 5557 belongs to the poorly populated class of massive, round, slow rotators that are predicted by semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations to be the end-product of a complex mass accretion history, involving ancient major mergers and more recent minor mergers. Our observations suggest that under specific circumstances a single binary merger may dominate the formation history of such objects and thus that at least some massive ETGs may form at relatively low redshift. Whether the two galaxies studied here are representative of their own sub-class of ETGs is still an open question that will be addressed by an on-going deep optical survey of ATLAS3D galaxies.},

abstract = {We make use of interferometric CO and H I observations, and optical integral-field spectroscopy from the ATLAS3D survey, to probe the origin of the molecular and ionized interstellar medium (ISM) in local early-type galaxies. We find that 36 ± 5 per cent of our sample of fast-rotating early-type galaxies have their ionized gas kinematically misaligned with respect to the stars, setting a strong lower limit on the importance of externally acquired gas (e.g. from mergers and cold accretion). Slow rotators have a flat distribution of misalignments, indicating that the dominant source of gas is external. The molecular, ionized and atomic gas in all the detected galaxies are always kinematically aligned, even when they are misaligned from the stars, suggesting that all these three phases of the ISM share a common origin. In addition, we find that the origin of the cold and warm gas in fast-rotating early-type galaxies is strongly affected by environment, despite the molecular gas detection rate and mass fractions being fairly independent of group/cluster membership. Galaxies in dense groups and the Virgo cluster nearly always have their molecular gas kinematically aligned with the stellar kinematics, consistent with a purely internal origin (presumably stellar mass loss). In the field, however, kinematic misalignments between the stellar and gaseous components indicate that at least 42 ± 5 per cent of local fast-rotating early-type galaxies have their gas supplied from external sources. When one also considers evidence of accretion present in the galaxies' atomic gas distributions, ≳46 per cent of fast-rotating field ETGs are likely to have acquired a detectable amount of ISM from accretion and mergers. We discuss several scenarios which could explain the environmental dichotomy, including preprocessing in galaxy groups/cluster outskirts and the morphological transformation of spiral galaxies, but we find it difficult to simultaneously explain the kinematic misalignment difference and the constant detection rate. Furthermore, our results suggest that galaxy mass may be an important independent factor associated with the origin of the gas, with the most massive fast-rotating galaxies in our sample (MK≲-24 mag; stellar mass of ≈8 × 1010 M⊙) always having kinematically aligned gas. This mass dependence appears to be independent of environment, suggesting it is caused by a separate physical mechanism.},

We find that the line ratios 12CO(1-0)/13CO(1-0) and 12CO(1-0)/HCN(1-0) are clearly correlated with several galaxy properties: total stellar mass, luminosity-weighted mean stellar age, molecular-to-atomic gas ratio, dust temperature and dust morphology. We suggest that these correlations are primarily governed by the optical depth in the 12CO lines; interacting, accreting and/or starbursting early-type galaxies have more optically thin molecular gas while those with settled dust and gas discs host optically thick molecular gas. The ranges of the integrated line intensity ratios generally overlap with those of spirals, although we note some outliers in the 12CO(1-0)/13CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1)/13CO(2-1) and HCN/HCO+(1-0) ratios. In particular, three galaxies are found to have very low 12CO(1-0)/13CO(1-0) and 12CO(2-1)/13CO(2-1) ratios. Such low ratios may signal particularly stable molecular gas which creates stars less efficiently than 'normal' (i.e. below Schmidt-Kennicutt prediction), consistent with the low dust temperatures seen in these galaxies.},

abstract = {We present the ATLAS3D H I survey of a volume-limited, complete sample of 166 nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs) brighter than MK=-21.5. The survey is mostly based on data taken with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, which enables us to detect H I down to 5 × 106-5 × 107 M⊙ within the survey volume.  We detect ˜40 per cent of all ETGs outside the Virgo galaxy cluster and ˜10 per cent of all ETGs inside it. This demonstrates that it is common for non-cluster ETGs to host H I. The morphology of the detected gas varies in a continuous way from regular, settled H I discs and rings to unsettled gas distributions (including tidal or accretion tails) and systems of clouds scattered around the galaxy. The majority of the detections consist of H I discs or rings (1/4 of all ETGs outside Virgo) so that if H I is detected in an ETG it is most likely distributed on a settled configuration. These systems come in two main types: small discs [? M⊙], which are confined within the stellar body and share the same kinematics of the stars; and large discs/rings [M(H I) up to 5 × 109 M⊙], which extend to tens of kpc from the host galaxy and are in half of the cases kinematically decoupled from the stars.  Neutral hydrogen seems to provide material for star formation in ETGs. Galaxies containing H I within ˜1Re exhibit signatures of on-going star formation in ˜70 per cent of the cases, approximately five times more frequently than galaxies without central H I. The interstellar medium (ISM) in the centre of these galaxies is dominated by molecular gas, and in ETGs with a small gas disc the conversion of H I into H2 is as efficient as in spirals.  The ETG H I mass function is characterized by M*˜ 2 × 109 M⊙ and by a slope $\alpha$˜-0.7. Compared to spirals, ETGs host much less H I as a family. However, a significant fraction of all ETGs are as H I-rich as spiral galaxies. The main difference between ETGs and spirals is that the former lack the high-column-density H I typical of the bright stellar disc of the latter.  The ETG H I properties vary with environment density in a more continuous way than suggested by the known Virgo versus non-Virgo dichotomy. We find an envelope of decreasing M(H I) and M(H I)/LK with increasing environment density. The gas-richest galaxies live in the poorest environments (as found also with CO observations), where the detection rate of star formation signatures is higher. Galaxies in the centre of Virgo have the lowest H I content, while galaxies at the outskirts of Virgo represent a transition region and can contain significant amounts of H I, indicating that at least a fraction of them has joined the cluster only recently after pre-processing in groups. Finally, we find an H I morphology-density relation such that at low environment density (measured on a local scale) the detected H I is mostly distributed on large, regular discs and rings, while more disturbed H I morphologies dominate environment densities typical of rich groups. This confirms the importance of processes occurring on a galaxy-group scale for the evolution of ETGs.},

abstract = {We investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barred galaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. We do this by trying to recover the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxy simulations using the Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) modelling method. However, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of an axisymmetric modelling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particular to inaccuracies in the deprojected mass model, our results are relevant for general axisymmetric modelling methods. We run N-body collisionless simulations to build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimic real individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. The final result of our evolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. The JAM method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatially constant M/L and anisotropy ? distributions. The models are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity moments ? of the simulations for various viewing angles [position angle (PA) of the bar and inclination of the galaxy]. We find that the inclination is generally well recovered by the JAM models, for both barred and unbarred simulations. For unbarred simulations the M/L is also accurately recovered, with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just $\Delta$(M/L) {\textless} 1.5 per cent when the galaxy is not too close to face on. At very low inclinations (?) the M/L can be significantly overestimated (9 per cent in our tests, but errors can be larger for very face-on views). This is in agreement with previous studies. For barred simulations the M/L is on average (when PA = 45°) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/underestimation of up to $\Delta$(M/L) = 15 per cent in our tests. The sign of the M/L bias depends on the PA of the bar as expected: overestimation occurs when the bar is closer to end-on, due to the increased stellar motion along the line-of-sight, and underestimation otherwise. For unbarred simulations, the JAM models are able to recover the mean value of the anisotropy with bias ?, within the region constrained by the kinematics. However when a bar is present, or for nearly face-on models, the recovered anisotropy varies wildly, with biases up to $\Delta$$\beta$z≈ 0.3.},

abstract = {We use interferometric 12CO(1-0) observations to compare and contrast the extent, surface brightness profiles and kinematics of the molecular gas in CO-rich ATLAS3D early-type galaxies (ETGs) and spiral galaxies. We find that the molecular gas extent is smaller in absolute terms in ETGs than in late-type galaxies, but that the size distributions are similar once scaled by the galaxies optical/stellar characteristic scalelengths. Amongst ETGs, we find that the extent of the gas is independent of its kinematic misalignment (with respect to the stars), but does depend on the environment, with Virgo cluster ETGs having less extended molecular gas reservoirs, further emphasizing that cluster ETGs follow different evolutionary pathways from those in the field. Approximately half of ETGs have molecular gas surface brightness profiles that follow the stellar light profile. These systems often have relaxed gas out to large radii, suggesting they are unlikely to have had recent merger/accretion events. A third of the sample galaxies show molecular gas surface brightness profiles that fall off slower than the light, and sometimes show a truncation. These galaxies often have a low mass, and either have disturbed molecular gas or are in the Virgo cluster, suggesting that recent mergers, ram pressure stripping and/or the presence of hot gas can compress/truncate the gas. The remaining galaxies have rings, or composite profiles, that we argue can be caused by the effects of bars. We investigated the kinematics of the molecular gas using position-velocity diagrams, and compared the observed kinematics with dynamical model predictions, and the observed stellar and ionized gas velocities. We confirm that the molecular gas reaches beyond the turnover of the circular velocity curve in ≈70 per cent of our CO-rich ATLAS3D ETGs, validating previous work on the CO Tully-Fisher relation. In general we find that in most galaxies the molecular gas is dynamically cold, and the observed CO rotation matches well model predictions of the circular velocity. In the galaxies with the largest molecular masses, dust obscuration and/or population gradients can cause model predictions of the circular velocity to disagree with observations of the molecular gas rotation; however, these effects are confined to the most star forming systems. Bars and non-equilibrium conditions can also make the gas deviate from circular orbits. In both these cases, one expects the model circular velocity to be higher than the observed CO velocity, in agreement with our observations. Molecular gas is a better direct tracer of the circular velocity than the ionized gas, justifying its use as a kinematic tracer for Tully-Fisher and similar analyses.},

abstract = {We study the volume-limited and nearly mass-selected (stellar mass Mstars ≳ 6 × 109 M⊙) ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs, ellipticals Es and lenticulars S0s). We construct detailed axisymmetric dynamical models (Jeans Anisotropic MGE), which allow for orbital anisotropy, include a dark matter halo and reproduce in detail both the galaxy images and the high-quality integral-field stellar kinematics out to about 1Re, the projected half-light radius. We derive accurate total mass-to-light ratios (M/L)e and dark matter fractions fDM, within a sphere of radius r={\{}R{\_}e{\}} centred on the galaxies. We also measure the stellar (M/L)stars and derive a median dark matter fraction fDM = 13 per cent in our sample. We infer masses MJAM ≡ L × (M/L)e ≈ 2 × M1/2, where M1/2 is the total mass within a sphere enclosing half of the galaxy light. We find that the thin two-dimensional subset spanned by galaxies in the (M{\_}JAM,$\sigma$ {\_}e,R{\_}e{\^{}}maj) coordinates system, which we call the Mass Plane (MP) has an observed rms scatter of 19 per cent, which implies an intrinsic one of 11 per cent. Here, R{\_}e{\^{}}maj is the major axis of an isophote enclosing half of the observed galaxy light, while $\sigma$e is measured within that isophote. The MP satisfies the scalar virial relation M{\_}JAM∝ $\sigma$ {\_}e{\^{}}2 R{\_}e{\^{}}maj within our tight errors. This show that the larger scatter in the Fundamental Plane (FP) (L, $\sigma$e, Re) is due to stellar population effects [including trends in the stellar initial mass function (IMF)]. It confirms that the FP deviation from the virial exponents is due to a genuine (M/L)e variation. However, the details of how both Re and $\sigma$e are determined are critical in defining the precise deviation from the virial exponents. The main uncertainty in masses or M/L estimates using the scalar virial relation is in the measurement of Re. This problem is already relevant for nearby galaxies and may cause significant biases in virial mass and size determinations at high redshift. Dynamical models can eliminate these problems. We revisit the (M/L)e-$\sigma$e relation, which describes most of the deviations between the MP and the FP. The best-fitting relation is (M/L){\_}e∝ $\sigma$ {\_}e{\^{}}{\{}0.72{\}} (r band). It provides an upper limit to any systematic increase of the IMF mass normalization with $\sigma$e. The correlation is more shallow and has smaller scatter for slow rotating systems or for galaxies in Virgo. For the latter, when using the best distance estimates, we observe a scatter in (M/L)e of 11 per cent, and infer an intrinsic one of 8 per cent. We perform an accurate empirical study of the link between $\sigma$e and the galaxies circular velocity Vcirc within 1Re (where stars dominate) and find the relation max (Vcirc) ≈ 1.76 × $\sigma$e, which has an observed scatter of 7 per cent. The accurate parameters described in this paper are used in the companion Paper XX (Cappellari et al.) of this series to explore the variation of global galaxy properties, including the IMF, on the projections of the MP.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the physical properties of the molecular gas in a sample of 18 molecular gas-rich early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the ATLAS3D sample. Our goal is to better understand the star formation processes occurring in those galaxies, starting here with the dense star-forming gas. We use existing integrated 12CO (1-0, 2-1), 13CO (1-0, 2-1), HCN (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) observations and new 12 CO (3-2) single-dish data. From these, we derive for the first time the average kinetic temperature, H2 volume density and column density of the emitting gas in a significant sample of ETGs, using a non-local thermodynamical equilibrium theoretical model. Since the CO lines trace different physical conditions than of those the HCN and HCO+ lines, the two sets of lines are treated separately. For most of the molecular gas-rich ETGs studied here, the CO transitions can be reproduced with kinetic temperatures of 10-20 K, H2 volume densities of 103-4 cm-3 and CO column densities of 10{\^{}}{\{}18-20{\}} cm-2. The physical conditions corresponding to the HCN and HCO+ gas component have large uncertainties and must be considered as indicative only. We also compare for the first time the predicted CO spectral line energy distributions and gas properties of our molecular gas-rich ETGs with those of a sample of nearby well-studied disc galaxies. The gas excitation conditions in 13 of our 18 ETGs appear analogous to those in the centre of the Milky Way, hence the star formation activity driving these conditions is likely of a similar strength and nature. Such results have never been obtained before for ETGs and open a new window to explore further star-formation processes in the Universe. The conclusions drawn should nevertheless be considered carefully, as they are based on a limited number of observations and on a simple model. In the near future, with higher CO transition observations, it should be possible to better identify the various gas components present in ETGs, as well as more precisely determine their associated physical conditions. To achieve these goals, we show here from our theoretical study, that mid-J CO lines [such as the 12CO (6-5) line] are particularly useful.},

abstract = {We analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the ATLAS3D sample by fitting a single S{\'{e}}rsic profile and decomposing all non-barred objects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parametrized by an exponential and a general S{\'{e}}rsic function. The aim of this analysis is to look for signatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies and compare them to kinematic properties. Using S{\'{e}}rsic index from single-component fits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- and early-type galaxies, is not recommended. Assuming that objects with n {\textgreater} 3 are slow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability to correctly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previously classified as ellipticals). We show that exponential sub-components, as well as light profiles fitted with only a single component of a low S{\'{e}}rsic index, can be linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. The median disc-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0, respectively. Similarly, the median S{\'{e}}rsic indices of the bulge (general S{\'{e}}rsic component) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. Overall, discs or disc-like structures are present in 83 per cent of early-type galaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disc-to-total light ratios. Discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent to the total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. The decomposition into discs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separation between fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a 59 per cent probability to correctly recognize slow rotators. We find trends between the angular momentum and the disc-to-total light ratios and the S{\'{e}}rsic index of the bulge, in the sense that high angular momentum galaxies have large disc-to-total light ratios and small bulge indices, but there is none between the angular momentum and the global S{\'{e}}rsic index. We investigate the inclination effects on the decomposition results and confirm that strong exponential profiles can be distinguished even at low inclinations, but medium-size discs are difficult to quantify using photometry alone at inclinations lower than ˜50°. Kinematics (i.e. projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influence of the inclination effects. We also find weak trends with mass and environmental density, where disc-dominated galaxies are typically less massive and found at all densities, including the densest region sampled by the ATLAS3D sample.},

Our full sample of 40 galaxies (30 newly mapped and 10 taken from the literature) is complete to a 12CO(1-0) integrated flux of 18.5 Jy km s-1, and it represents the largest, best studied sample of its type to date. A comparison of the CO distribution of each galaxy to the g - r colour image (representing dust) shows that the molecular gas and dust distributions are in good agreement and trace the same underlying interstellar medium. The galaxies exhibit a variety of CO morphologies, including discs (50 per cent), rings (15 per cent), bars+rings (10 per cent), spiral arms (5 per cent) and mildly (12.5 per cent) and strongly (7.5 per cent) disrupted morphologies. There appear to be weak trends between galaxy mass and CO morphology, whereby the most massive galaxies in the sample tend to have molecular gas in a disc morphology.

abstract = {For early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, X-ray-emitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star formation history. A halo of hot gas may act as an effective shield against the acquisition of cold gas and can quickly absorb stellar mass loss material. Yet, since the discovery by the Einstein Observatory of such X-ray haloes around early-type galaxies, the precise amount of hot gas around these galaxies still remains a matter of debate. By combining homogeneously derived photometric and spectroscopic measurements for the early-type galaxies observed as part of the ATLAS3D integral field survey with measurements of their X-ray luminosity based on X-ray data of both low and high spatial resolution (for 47 and 19 objects, respectively) we conclude that the hot gas content of early-type galaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. Specifically, whereas slow rotators generally have X-ray haloes with luminosity LX, gas and temperature T values that are well in line with what is expected if the hot gas emission is sustained by the thermalization of the kinetic energy carried by the stellar mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display LX, gas values that fall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar T values that do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy (traced by the stellar velocity dispersion) as observed in the case of slow rotators. Such a discrepancy between the hot gas content of slow and fast rotators would appear to reduce, or even disappear, for large values of the dynamical mass (above ˜3 × 1011 M⊙), with younger fast rotators displaying also somewhat larger LX, gas values possibly owing to the additional energy input from recent supernovae explosions. Considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsically flatter than slow rotators, and that the few LX, gas-deficient slow rotators also happen to be relatively flat, the observed LX, gas deficiency in these objects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a harder time in retaining their hot gas, although we suggest that the degree of rotational support could further hamper the efficiency with which the kinetic energy of the stellar mass loss material is thermalized in the hot gas. We discuss the implications that a different hot gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally produced gaseous material, considering in particular how the LX, gas deficiency of fast rotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar mass loss material into new stars than slow rotators. This would be consistent with the finding that molecular gas and young stellar populations are detected only in fast rotators across the entire ATLAS3D sample, and that fast rotators tend to have a larger specific dust mass content than slow rotators.},

Here, we use those parameters to study the two orthogonal projections ({\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}, {\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}) and ({\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}, {\{}R{\_}e{\^{}}maj{\}}) of the thin Mass Plane (MP) ({\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}, {\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}, {\{}R{\_}e{\^{}}maj{\}}) which describes the distribution of the galaxy population, where {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}≡ L× (M/L){\_}JAM≈ M{\_}star. The distribution of galaxy properties on both projections of the MP is characterized by: (i) the same zone of exclusion (ZOE), which can be transformed from one projection to the other using the scalar virial equation. The ZOE is roughly described by two power laws, joined by a break at a characteristic mass {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}≈ 3× 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} {\{} M{\_}{\{}⊙{\}}{\}}, which corresponds to the minimum Re and maximum stellar density. This results in a break in the mean {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}-{\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}} relation with trends {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}∝ $\sigma$ {\_}e{\^{}}{\{}2.3{\}} and {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}∝ $\sigma$ {\_}e{\^{}}{\{}4.7{\}} at small and large $\sigma$e, respectively; (ii) a characteristic mass {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}≈ 2× 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} {\{} M{\_}{\{}⊙{\}}{\}} which separates a population dominated by flat fast rotator with discs and spiral galaxies at lower masses, from one dominated by quite round slow rotators at larger masses; (iii) below that mass the distribution of ETGs' properties on the two projections of the MP tends to be constant along lines of roughly constant $\sigma$e, or equivalently along lines with {\{}R{\_}e{\^{}}maj{\}}∝ {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}, respectively (or even better parallel to the ZOE: {\{}R{\_}e{\^{}}maj{\}}∝ M{\_}JAM{\^{}}{\{}0.75{\}}); (iv) it forms a continuous and parallel sequence with the distribution of spiral galaxies; (v) at even lower masses, the distribution of fast-rotator ETGs and late spirals naturally extends to that of dwarf ETGs (Sph) and dwarf irregulars (Im), respectively.  We use dynamical models to analyse our kinematic maps. We show that $\sigma$e traces the bulge fraction, which appears to be the main driver for the observed trends in the dynamical (M/L)JAM and in indicators of the (M/L)pop of the stellar population like H$\beta$ and colour, as well as in the molecular gas fraction. A similar variation along contours of $\sigma$e is also observed for the mass normalization of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which was recently shown to vary systematically within the ETGs' population. Our preferred relation has the form log {\_}{\{}10{\}} [(M/L){\_}stars/(M/L){\_}Salp]=a+b× log {\_}{\{}10{\}}({\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}/130 {\{}km s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\}}) with a = -0.12 ± 0.01 and b = 0.35 ± 0.06. Unless there are major flaws in all stellar population models, this trend implies a transition of the mean IMF from Kroupa to Salpeter in the interval log {\_}{\{}10{\}}({\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}/{\{}km s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}})≈ 1.9-2.5 (or {\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}≈ 90-290 km s-1), with a smooth variation in between, consistently with what was shown in Cappellari et al. The observed distribution of galaxy properties on the MP provides a clean and novel view for a number of previously reported trends, which constitute special two-dimensional projections of the more general four-dimensional parameters trends on the MP. We interpret it as due to a combination of two main effects: (i) an increase of the bulge fraction, which increases $\sigma$e, decreases Re, and greatly enhance the likelihood for a galaxy to have its star formation quenched, and (ii) dry merging, increasing galaxy mass and Re by moving galaxies along lines of roughly constant $\sigma$e (or steeper), while leaving the population nearly unchanged.},

abstract = {We explore the connection between the local escape velocity, Vesc, and the stellar population properties in the ATLAS3D survey, a complete, volume-limited sample of nearby early-type galaxies. We make use of ugriz photometry to construct Multi-Gaussian Expansion models of the surface brightnesses of our galaxies. We are able to fit the full range of surface brightness profiles found in our sample, and in addition we reproduce the results of state-of-the-art photometry in the literature with residuals of 0.04 mag. We utilize these photometric models and SAURON integral-field spectroscopy, combined with Jeans dynamical modelling, to determine the local Vesc derived from the surface brightness. We find that the local Vesc is tightly correlated with the Mg b and Fe5015 line strengths and optical colours, and anti-correlated with the H$\beta$ line strength. In the case of the Mg b and colour-Vesc relations we find that the relation within individual galaxies follows the global relation between different galaxies. We intentionally ignored any uncertain contribution due to dark matter since we are seeking an empirical description of stellar population gradients in early-type galaxies that is ideal for quantitative comparison with model predictions. We also make use of single stellar population (SSP) modelling to transform our line strength index measurements into the SSP-equivalent parameters age (t), metallicity ([Z/H]) and $\alpha$-enhancement [$\alpha$/Fe]. The residuals from the relation are correlated with age, [$\alpha$/Fe], molecular gas mass and local environmental density. We identify a population of galaxies that occur only at low Vesc that exhibit negative gradients in the Mg b- and Colour-Vesc relations. These galaxies typically have young central stellar populations and contain significant amounts of molecular gas and dust. Combining these results with N-body simulations of binary mergers we use the Mg b-Vesc relation to constrain the possible number of dry mergers experienced by the local early-type galaxy population - a typical massive early-type galaxy can have experienced only ˜1.5 major mergers before becoming a significant outlier in the Mg b-Vesc relation.},

abstract = {We study the global efficiency of star formation in high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type and spiral galaxies. Despite using a universal local law to form stars in the simulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spirals on the large-scale Kennicutt relation, and form stars two to five times less efficiently. This offset is in agreement with previous results on morphological quenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded in early-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. As a result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach as high densities as in the spiral galaxies. Even if some molecular gas is present, the fraction of very dense gas (typically above 104 cm-3) is significantly reduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. We also analyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their CO and H I surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by their non-stellar 8 $\mu$m emission. As predicted by the simulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the Kennicutt relation compared to the spirals, with a twice lower efficiency. Finally, we validate our approach by performing a direct comparison between models and observations. We run a simulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of NGC 524, a local lenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation rate in good agreement with the observations. Morphological quenching thus seems to be a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of a reduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the COLD GASS survey. This lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain the formation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening of some galaxies.},

abstract = {We investigate nuclear light profiles in 135 ATLAS3D galaxies for which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging is available and compare them to the large-scale kinematics obtained with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph. Specific angular momentum, $\lambda$R, correlates with the shape of nuclear light profiles, where, as suggested by previous studies, cores are typically found in slow rotators and core-less galaxies are fast rotators. As also shown before, cores are found only in massive galaxies and only in systems with the stellar mass (measured via dynamical models) M ≳ 8 × 1010 M⊙. Based on our sample, we, however, see no evidence for a bimodal distribution of nuclear slopes. The best predictor for finding a core is based on the stellar velocity dispersion within an effective radius, $\sigma$e, and specific angular momentum, where cores are found for $\lambda$R ≲ 0.25 and $\sigma$e ≳ 160 km s-1. We estimate that only about 10 per cent of nearby early-type galaxies contain cores. Furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of fast rotators with cores. We also show that core fast rotators are morphologically, kinematically and dynamically different from core slow rotators. The cores of fast rotators, however, could harbour black holes of similar masses to those in core slow rotators, but typically more massive than those found in core-less fast rotators. Cores of both fast and slow rotators are made of old stars and found in galaxies typically lacking molecular or atomic gas (with a few exceptions). Core-less galaxies, and especially core-less fast rotators, are underluminous in the diffuse X-ray emission, but the presence of a core does not imply high X-ray luminosities. Additionally, we postulate (as many of these galaxies lack HST imaging) a possible population of core-less galaxies among slow rotators, which cannot be explained as face-on discs, but comprise a genuine sub-population of slow rotators. These galaxies are typically less massive and flatter than core slow rotators, and show evidence for dynamical cold structures and exponential photometric components. Based on our findings, major non-dissipative (gas-poor) mergers together with black hole binary evolution may not be the only path for formation of cores in early-type galaxies. We discuss possible processes for formation of cores and their subsequent preservation.},

abstract = {We use the ATLAS3D sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes of early-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric and kinematic data. Based on our ellipticity measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, and additional imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotators under the assumption of axisymmetry. The so-obtained intrinsic shape distribution for the fast rotators can be described with a Gaussian with a mean flattening of q = 0.25 and standard deviation $\sigma$q = 0.14, and an additional tail towards rounder shapes. The slow rotators are much rounder, and are well described with a Gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and $\sigma$q = 0.09. We then checked that our results were consistent when applying a different and independent method to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observed ellipticity distributions directly using Gaussian parametrizations for the intrinsic axis ratios. Although both fast and slow rotators are identified as early-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shape studies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions are significantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. The intrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with the spiral galaxy population. Including the observed kinematic misalignment in our intrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantly axisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. For the slow rotators though there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.},

abstract = {We present a detailed two-dimensional stellar dynamical analysis of a sample of 44 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of individual central galaxies with stellar masses of 2 × 1010 M⊙ ≲ M* ≲ 6 × 1011 M⊙. Kinematic maps of the stellar line-of-sight velocity, velocity dispersion and higher order Gauss-Hermite moments h3 and h4 are constructed for each central galaxy and for the most massive satellites. The amount of rotation is quantified using the $\lambda$R-parameter. The velocity, velocity dispersion, h3 and h4 fields of the simulated galaxies show a diversity similar to observed kinematic maps of early-type galaxies in the ATLAS3D survey. This includes fast (regular), slow and misaligned rotation, hot spheroids with embedded cold disc components as well as galaxies with counter-rotating cores or central depressions in the velocity dispersion. We link the present-day kinematic properties to the individual cosmological formation histories of the galaxies. In general, major galaxy mergers have a significant influence on the rotation properties resulting in both a spin-down as well as a spin-up of the merger remnant. Lower mass galaxies with significant (≳18 per cent) in situ formation of stars since z ≈ 2, or with additional gas-rich major mergers - resulting in a spin-up - in their formation history, form elongated (ɛ ˜ 0.45) fast rotators ($\lambda$R ˜ 0.46) with a clear anticorrelation of h3 and v/$\sigma$. An additional formation path for fast rotators includes gas-poor major mergers leading to a spin-up of the remnants ($\lambda$R ˜ 0.43). This formation path does not result in anticorrelated h3 and v/$\sigma$. The formation histories of slow rotators can include late major mergers. If the merger is gas rich, the remnant typically is a less flattened slow rotator with a central dip in the velocity dispersion. If the merger is gas poor, the remnant is very elongated (ɛ ˜ 0.43) and slowly rotating ($\lambda$R ˜ 0.11). The galaxies most consistent with the rare class of non-rotating round early-type galaxies grow by gas-poor minor mergers alone. In general, more massive galaxies have less in situ star formation since z ˜ 2, rotate slower and have older stellar populations. We discuss general implications for the formation of fast and slowly rotating galaxies as well as the weaknesses and strengths of the underlying models.},

abstract = {One quarter of all nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs) outside Virgo host a disc/ring of H I with size from a few to tens of kpc and mass up to ˜109 M⊙. Here we investigate whether this H I is related to the presence of a stellar disc within the host making use of the classification of ETGs in fast and slow rotators (FR/SR). We find a large diversity of H I masses and morphologies within both families. Surprisingly, SRs are detected as often, host as much H I and have a similar rate of H I discs/rings as FRs. Accretion of H I is therefore not always linked to the growth of an inner stellar disc. The weak relation between H I and stellar disc is confirmed by their frequent kinematical misalignment in FRs, including cases of polar and counterrotating gas. In SRs the H I is usually polar. This complex picture highlights a diversity of ETG formation histories which may be lost in the relative simplicity of their inner structure and emerges when studying their outer regions. We find that $\Lambda$ CDM hydrodynamical simulations have difficulties reproducing the H I properties of ETGs. The gas discs formed in simulations are either too massive or too small depending on the star formation feedback implementation. Kinematical misalignments match the observations only qualitatively. The main point of conflict is that nearly all simulated FRs and a large fraction of all simulated SRs host corotating H I. This establishes the H I properties of ETGs as a novel challenge to simulations.},

abstract = {We present a study of the cold gas contents of the ATLAS3D early-type galaxies, in the context of their optical colours, near-ultraviolet colours and H$\beta$ absorption line strengths. Early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies are not as gas poor as previously thought, and at least 40 per cent of local early-type galaxies are now known to contain molecular and/or atomic gas. This cold gas offers the opportunity to study recent galaxy evolution through the processes of cold gas acquisition, consumption (star formation) and removal. Molecular and atomic gas detection rates range from 10 to 34 per cent in red sequence early-type galaxies, depending on how the red sequence is defined, and from 50 to 70 per cent in blue early-type galaxies. Notably, massive red sequence early-type galaxies (stellar masses {\textgreater}5 × 1010 M⊙, derived from dynamical models) are found to have H I masses up to M(H I)/M* ˜ 0.06 and H2 masses up to M(H2)/M* ˜ 0.01. Some 20 per cent of all massive early-type galaxies may have retained atomic and/or molecular gas through their transition to the red sequence. However, kinematic and metallicity signatures of external gas accretion (either from satellite galaxies or the intergalactic medium) are also common, particularly at stellar masses ≤5 × 1010 M⊙, where such signatures are found in ˜50 per cent of H2-rich early-type galaxies. Our data are thus consistent with a scenario in which fast rotator early-type galaxies are quenched former spiral galaxies which have undergone some bulge growth processes, and in addition, some of them also experience cold gas accretion which can initiate a period of modest star formation activity. We discuss implications for the interpretation of colour-magnitude diagrams.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the star formation rate (SFR) in the early-type galaxies (ETGs) of the ATLAS3D sample, based on Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) 22 $\mu$m and Galaxy Evolution Explorer far-ultraviolet emission. We combine these with gas masses estimated from 12CO and H I data in order to investigate the star formation efficiency (SFE) in a larger sample of ETGs than previously available. We first recalibrate (based on WISE data) the relation between old stellar populations (traced at Ks band) and 22 $\mu$m luminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22 $\mu$m emission from circumstellar dust. We then go on to investigate the position of ETGs on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation. Molecular gas-rich ETGs have comparable star formation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they lie systematically offset from the KS relation, having lower SFEs by a factor of ≈2.5 (in agreement with other authors). This effect is driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material is in the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. We show here for the first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass per unit time is lower in ETGs, it seems that the amount of stars formed per free-fall time is approximately constant. The scatter around this dynamical relation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of the potential in the inner regions. This leads us to suggest that dynamical properties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be important second parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatter around star formation relations.},

abstract = {The unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. One important observational constraint is the correlation between UV-optical colours and Mg2 line strengths found by Burstein et al. The simplest interpretation of this phenomenon is that the UV strength is related to the Mg line strength. Under this assumption, we expect galaxies with larger Mg gradients to have larger UV colour gradients. By combining UV imaging from GALEX, optical imaging from MDM and SAURON integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially resolved relationships between UV colours and stellar population properties of 34 early-type galaxies from the SAURON survey sample. We find that galaxies with old stellar populations show tight correlations between the far-UV (FUV) colours (FUV -V and FUV - NUV) and the Mg b index, H{\{}beta{\}} index and metallicity [Z/H]. The equivalent correlations for the Fe5015 index, -enhancement [/Fe] and age are present but weaker. We have also derived logarithmic internal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar population gradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the FUV -V and FUV - NUV colour gradients on both the Mg b line strength and the metallicity gradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. In particular, global gradients of Mg b and [Z/H] with respect to the UV colour [e.g. {\{}Delta{\}}(Mg b)/{\{}Delta{\}}(FUV - NUV) and {\{}Delta{\}}[Z/H]/{\{}Delta{\}}(FUV - NUV)] across galaxies are consistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that the global correlations also hold locally. From a simple model based on multiband colour fits of UV upturn and UV-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausible range of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. In these models, the centres of elliptical galaxies, where the UV flux is strong, are enhanced in metals by roughly 60 per cent compared to UV-weak regions.},

abstract = {We present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity (Vesc)- line strength index relationship for 48 early-type galaxies from the SAURON sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies with both detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling. Values of Vesc are computed using multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) photometric fitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic Jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneously on Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based images. We determine line strengths and escape velocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation of the correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. We find a tight correlation between Vesc and the line-strength indices. For Mgb, we find that this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but also inside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. The Mgb-Vesc relation has the form: log(Mgb/4 A) = (0.32 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.03) log(Vesc/500 km s-1) - (0.031 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.007) with an rms scatter {\{}sigma{\}}= 0.033. The relation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the global relation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsic scatter in the local gradients. We transform our line strength index measurements to the single stellar population (SSP) equivalent ages (t), metallicity ([Z/H]) and enhancement ([/Fe]) and carry out a principal component analysis of our SSP and Vesc data. We find that in this four-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a good approximation confined to a plane, given by log (V esc/500 km s -1) = 0.85 [Z/H]+ 0.43 log (t/Gyr) - 0.29. It is surprising that a combination of age and metallicity is conserved; this may indicate a  conspiracy' between age and metallicity or a weakness in the SSP models. How the connection between stellar populations and the gravitational potential, both locally and globally, is preserved as galaxies assemble hierarchically may provide an important constraint on modelling.},

We find a tight relation between the [3.6]-[4.5] colour and effective velocity dispersion, a good mass indicator in early-type galaxies: ([3.6]-[4.5])e = (-0.109 [IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu1.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} 0.007)[IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu2.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater}+ (0.154 [IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu3.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} 0.016). Contrary to other colours in the optical and near-infrared, we find that the colours become bluer for larger galaxies. The relations are tighter when using the colour inside re (scatter 0.013 mag), rather than the much smaller re/8 aperture (scatter 0.023 mag), due to the presence of young populations in the central regions. We also obtain strong correlations between the [3.6]-[4.5] colour and three strong absorption lines (H[IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu4.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater}, Mgb and Fe 5015). Comparing our data with the models of Marigo et al., which show that more metal rich galaxies are bluer, we can explain our results in a way consistent with results from the optical, by stating that larger galaxies are more metal rich. The blueing is caused by a strong CO absorption band, whose line strength increases strongly with decreasing temperature and which covers a considerable fraction of the 4.5-[IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu5.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater}m filter. In galaxies that contain a compact radio source, the [3.6]-[4.5] colour is generally slightly redder (by 0.015 [IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu6.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} 0.007 mag using the re/8 aperture) than in the other galaxies, indicating small amounts of either hot dust, non-thermal emission, or young stars near the centre.

Removing the regions with evidence for young stellar populations (from the H[IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu7.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} absorption line) and interpreting the colour gradients as metallicity gradients, we find that our galaxies are more metal poor going outwards. The radial [3.6]-[4.5] gradients correlate very well with the metallicity gradients derived from optical line indices. We do not find any correlation between the gradients and galaxy mass; at every mass, galaxies display a real range in metallicity gradients. Consistent with our previous work on line indices, we find a tight relation between local [3.6]-[4.5] colour and local escape velocity. The small scatter from galaxy to galaxy, although not negligible, shows that the amount and distribution of the dark matter relative to the visible light cannot be too different from galaxy to galaxy. Due to the lower sensitivity of the [3.6]-[4.5] colour to young stellar populations, this relation is more useful to infer the galaxy potential than the Mgb-vesc relation.},

These correlations put stringent constraints on the origin of the UV-upturn phenomenon in early-type galaxies and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. In particular, despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between FUV -V colour and Mg line strength originally publicized by Burstein et al., which we refer to as the  Burstein relation', suggesting a positive dependence of the UV upturn on metallicity. We argue that the scatter in the correlations is real and present mild evidence that a strong UV excess is preferentially present in slow-rotating galaxies. We also demonstrate that most outliers in the correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some at very low levels. We believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation, afforded by the deep and varied data available for the SAURON sample, explains why our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallower surveys. This is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully crafted sample of more distant early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.},

abstract = {We present absorption-line strength maps of a sample of 24 representative early-type spiral galaxies, mostly of type Sa, obtained as part of the SAURON (Spectrographic Areal Unit for Research on Optical Nebulae) survey of nearby galaxies using our custom-built integral-field spectrograph. Using high-quality spectra, spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise ratio, we measure several key age, metallicity and abundance ratio sensitive indices from the Lick Observatory Image Dissector Scanner (Lick/IDS) system over a contiguous two-dimensional field including bulge and inner disc. We present maps of H{\{}beta{\}}, Fe 5015 and Mg b for each galaxy. We find that Sa galaxies on the average have slightly smaller Mg b and Fe 5015 line strengths than ellipticals and S0s, and higher H{\{}beta{\}} values, but with a much larger scatter. The absorption-line maps show that many galaxies contain some younger populations ([{\&}le;]1 Gyr), distributed in small or large inner discs, or in circumnuclear star-forming rings. In many cases these young stars are formed in circumnuclear ministarbursts, which are dominating the light in the centres of some of the early-type spirals. These ministarburst cause a considerable scatter in index-index diagrams such as Mg b-H{\{}beta{\}} and Mg b-Fe 5015, more than is measured for early-type galaxies. We find that the central regions of Sa galaxies display a wide range in ages, even within the galaxies. We find that the central regions of early-type spirals are often dusty, with a good correlation between the presence of young central stellar populations and a significant amount of dust extinction. 50 per cent of the sample show velocity dispersion drops in their centres. All of the galaxies of our sample lie on or below the Mg b-{\{}sigma{\}} relation for elliptical galaxies in the Coma cluster, and above the H{\{}beta{\}} absorption line-{\{}sigma{\}} relation for elliptical galaxies. If those relations are considered to be relations for the oldest local galaxies we see that our sample of spirals has a considerable scatter in age, with the largest scatter at the lowest {\{}sigma{\}}. This is in disagreement with highly inclined samples, in which generally only old stellar populations are found in the central regions. The discrepancy between our sample and highly inclined samples, and the presence of so many stellar velocity dispersion dips, i.e. so-called {\{}sigma{\}} drops, in these spiral galaxies with large bulges (type Sa) can be understood if the central regions of Sa galaxies contain at least two components: a thin, disc-like component, often containing recent star formation, and another, elliptical-like component, consisting of old stars and rotating more slowly, dominating the light above the plane. These components together form the photometrically defined bulge, in the same way as the thin and the thick disc co-exist in the solar neighbourhood. In this picture, consistent with the current literature, part of the bulge, the thicker component, formed a very long time ago. Later, stars continued to form in the central regions of the disc, rejuvenating in this way the bulge through dynamical processes. This picture is able to explain in a natural way the heterogeneous stellar populations and star formation characteristics that we are seeing in detailed observations of early-type spiral galaxies.},

abstract = {We analysed two-dimensional maps of 48 early-type galaxies obtained with the SAURON and OASIS integral-field spectrographs using kinemetry, a generalization of surface photometry to the higher order moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD). The maps analysed include: reconstructed image, mean velocity, velocity dispersion, h3 and h4 Gauss-Hermite moments. Kinemetry is a good method to recognize structures otherwise missed by using surface photometry, such as embedded discs and kinematic subcomponents. In the SAURON sample, we find that 31 per cent of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91 per cent of the multicomponents systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest having three. In addition, 29 per cent of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components, nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. We differentiate between slow and fast rotators using velocity maps only and find that fast-rotating galaxies contain discs with a large range in mass fractions to the main body. Specifically, we find that the velocity maps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined discs, except in the transition regions between kinematic subcomponents. This deviation is measured with the kinemetric k5/k1 ratio, which is large and noisy in slow rotators and about 2 per cent in fast rotators. In terms of E/S0 classification, this means that 74 per cent of Es and 92 per cent of S0s have components with disc-like kinematics. We suggest that differences in k5/k1 values for the fast and slow rotators arise from their different intrinsic structure which is reflected on the velocity maps. For the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axial ratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary to what is predicted with isotropic Jeans models viewed at different inclinations. The position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly in slow rotators. Velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similar to the distribution of light. Velocity dispersion maps of the edge-on fast rotators and all slow rotators show differences which can only be partially explained with isotropic models and, in the case of fast rotators, often require additional cold components. We constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3-V/{\{}sigma{\}} and h4-V/{\{}sigma{\}} diagrams from SAURON observations. We confirm the classical anticorrelation of h3 and V/{\{}sigma{\}}, but we also find that h3 is almost zero in some objects or even weakly correlated with V/{\{}sigma{\}}. The distribution of h4 for fast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average. In general, fast rotators contain flattened components characterized by a disc-like rotation. The difference between slow and fast rotators is traceable throughout all moments of the LOSVD, with evidence for different intrinsic shapes and orbital contents and, hence, likely different evolutionary paths.},

abstract = {We present a stellar population analysis of the absorption line strength maps for 48 early-type galaxies from the SAURON sample. Using the line strength index maps of H{\{}beta{\}}, Fe5015 and Mg b, measured in the Lick/IDS system and spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise ratio, together with predictions from up-to-date stellar population models, we estimate the simple stellar population-equivalent (SSP-equivalent) age, metallicity and abundance ratio [/Fe] over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately one effective radius. A discussion of calibrations and differences between model predictions is given. Maps of SSP-equivalent age, metallicity and abundance ratio [/Fe] are presented for each galaxy. We find a large range of SSP-equivalent ages in our sample, of which [{\~{}}]40 per cent of the galaxies show signs of a contribution from a young stellar population. The most extreme cases of post-starburst galaxies, with SSP-equivalent ages of [{\&}le;]3 Gyr observed over the full field-of-view, and sometimes even showing signs of residual star formation, are restricted to low-mass systems ({\{}sigma{\}}e[{\&}le;] 100 km s-1 or [{\~{}}]2 x 1010 M{\{}odot{\}}). Spatially restricted cases of young stellar populations in circumnuclear regions can almost exclusively be linked to the presence of star formation in a thin, dusty disc/ring, also seen in the near-UV or mid-IR on top of an older underlying stellar population. The flattened components with disc-like kinematics previously identified in all fast rotators are shown to be connected to regions of distinct stellar populations. These range from the young, still star-forming circumnuclear discs and rings with increased metallicity preferentially found in intermediate-mass fast rotators, to apparently old structures with extended disc-like kinematics, which are observed to have an increased metallicity and mildly depressed [/Fe] ratio compared to the main body of the galaxy. The slow rotators, often harbouring kinematically decoupled components (KDC) in their central regions, generally show no stellar population signatures over and above the well-known metallicity gradients in early-type galaxies and are largely consistent with old ([{\&}ge;]10 Gyr) stellar populations. Using radially averaged stellar population gradients we find in agreement with Spolaor et al. a mass-metallicity gradient relation where low-mass fast rotators form a sequence of increasing metallicity gradient with increasing mass. For more massive systems (above [{\~{}}]3.5 x 1010 M{\{}odot{\}}) there is an overall downturn such that metallicity gradients become shallower with increased scatter at a given mass leading to the most massive systems being slow rotators with relatively shallow metallicity gradients. The observed shallower metallicity gradients and increased scatter could be a consequence of the competition between different star formation and assembly scenarios following a general trend of diminishing gas fractions and more equal-mass mergers with increasing mass, leading to the most massive systems being devoid of ordered motion and signs of recent star formation.},

We define a new parameter [IMG]/medium/mnras0379-0401-mu1.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater}, which involves luminosity-weighted averages over the full two-dimensional kinematic field as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellar angular momentum per unit mass. We use it as a basis for a new kinematic classification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators, depending on whether they have {\{}lambda{\}}R values within their effective radius Re below or above 0.1, respectively. Slow and fast rotators are shown to be physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the consequence of a biased viewing angle. Fast rotators tend to be relatively low-luminosity galaxies with MB{\{}gtrsim{\}}-20.5. Slow rotators tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are still spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. Three slow rotators of our sample, among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. Remarkably, all other slow rotators (besides the atypical case of NGC 4550) contain a large kpc-scale kinematically decoupled core (KDC). All fast rotators (except one galaxy with well-known irregular shells) show well-aligned photometric and kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most slow rotators which exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. These results are supported by a supplement of 18 additional early-type galaxies observed with SAURON. In a companion paper (Paper X), we also show that fast and slow rotators are distinct classes in terms of their orbital distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formation and evolution of fast rotators, and that the slowest rotators are the extreme evolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells where dissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which most of the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards. Detailed numerical simulations in a cosmological context are required to understand how to form large-scale KDCs within slow rotators, and more generally to explain the distribution of {\{}lambda{\}}R values within early-type galaxies and the distinction between fast and slow rotators.},

abstract = {We combine SAURON integral field data of a representative sample of local early-type, red sequence galaxies with Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera imaging in order to investigate the presence of trace star formation in these systems. With the Spitzer data, we identify galaxies hosting low-level star formation, as traced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, with measured star formation rates that compare well to those estimated from other tracers. This star formation proceeds according to established scaling relations with molecular gas content, in surface density regimes characteristic of disc galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts. We find that star formation in early-type galaxies happens exclusively in fast-rotating systems and occurs in two distinct modes. In the first, star formation is a diffuse process, corresponding to widespread young stellar populations and high molecular gas content. The equal presence of co- and counter-rotating components in these systems strongly implies an external origin for the star-forming gas, and we argue that these star formation events may be the final stages of (mostly minor) mergers that build up the bulges of red sequence lenticulars. In the second mode of star formation, the process is concentrated into well-defined disc or ring morphologies, outside of which the host galaxies exhibit uniformly evolved stellar populations. This implies that these star formation events represent rejuvenations within previously quiescent stellar systems. Evidence for earlier star formation events similar to these in all fast-rotating early-type galaxies suggests that this mode of star formation may be common to all such galaxies, with a duty cycle of roughly 1/10, and likely contributes to the embedded, corotating inner stellar discs ubiquitous in this population.},

abstract = {We analyse the orbital distribution of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies using SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics within about one effective (half-light) radius. We construct the anisotropy diagram, which relates the ratio of the ordered and random motion in a galaxy (V/{\{}sigma{\}}) to its observed ellipticity ({\{}varepsilon{\}}), for the 48 E/S0 galaxies from the SAURON survey. For a subsample of 24 galaxies consistent with axisymmetry, we use three-integral axisymmetric Schwarzschild dynamical models to recover the detailed orbital distribution, and we find good agreement with the anisotropy derived from the (V/{\{}sigma{\}}, {\{}varepsilon{\}}) diagram. In a companion paper (Paper IX), we show that the early-type galaxies can be subdivided into two classes of systems with or without a significant amount of specific stellar angular momentum. Here, we show that the two classes have different distributions on the (V/{\{}sigma{\}}, {\{}varepsilon{\}}) diagram. The slow rotators are more common among the most massive systems and are generally classified as E from photometry alone. Those in our sample tend to be fairly round ({\{}varepsilon{\}}[lsim] 0.3), but can have significant kinematical misalignments, indicating that as a class they are moderately triaxial, and span a range of anisotropies ({\{}delta{\}}[lsim] 0.3). The fast rotators are generally fainter and are classified as either E or S0. They can appear quite flattened ({\{}varepsilon{\}}[lsim] 0.7), do not show significant kinematical misalignments (unless barred or interacting), indicating they are nearly axisymmetric and span an even larger range of anisotropies ({\{}delta{\}}[lsim] 0.5). These results are confirmed when we extend our analysis to 18 additional E/S0 galaxies observed with SAURON. The dynamical models indicate that the anisotropy inferred from the (V/{\{}sigma{\}}, {\{}varepsilon{\}}) diagram is due to a flattening of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane ({\{}sigma{\}}R {\textgreater} {\{}sigma{\}}z), which we quantify with the {\{}beta{\}} anisotropy parameter. We find a trend of increasing {\{}beta{\}} for intrinsically flatter galaxies. A number of the fast rotators show evidence for containing a flattened, kinematically distinct component, which in some cases counter-rotates relative to the main galaxy body. These components are generally more metal rich than the galaxy body. All these results support the idea that fast rotators are nearly oblate and contain disc-like components. The role of gas must have been important for their formation. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial. Current collisionless merger models seem unable to explain their detailed observed properties.},

The surface brightness profiles of nine galaxies ({\{}approx{\}}26 per cent) show regions with blue UV-optical colours suggesting RSF. Five of these ({\{}approx{\}}15 per cent) show blue integrated UV-optical colours that set them aside in the NUV integrated colour-magnitude relation. These are objects with either exceptionally intense and localized NUV fluxes or blue UV-optical colours throughout. They also have other properties confirming they have had RSF, in particular H{\{}beta{\}} absorption higher than expected for a quiescent population and a higher CO detection rate. This suggests that residual star formation is more common in early-type galaxies than we are used to believe. NUV blue galaxies are generally drawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion ({\{}sigma{\}}e {\textless} 200 km s-1) and thus lower dynamical mass part of the sample. We have also constructed the first UV Fundamental Planes and show that NUV blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. If they are eliminated, the fits get closer to expectations from the virial theorem. Although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that a dominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the UV Fundamental Planes is due to the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies. Interestingly, the UV-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety of behaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of RSF, a central UV-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicity gradients and in many cases a combination of these. In addition, FUV-NUV and FUV-V colours even bluer than those normally associated with UV-upturn galaxies are observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. Four out of the five UV-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. These objects should thus pose interesting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the UV upturn.},

abstract = {Early results are reported from the SAURON survey of the kinematics and stellar populations of a representative sample of nearby E, S0 and Sa galaxies. The survey is aimed at determining the intrinsic shape of the galaxies, their orbital structure, the mass-to-light ratio as a function of radius, the age and metallicity of the stellar populations, and the frequency of kinematically decoupled cores and nuclear black holes. The construction of the representative sample is described, and its properties are illustrated. A comparison with long-slit spectroscopic data establishes that the SAURON measurements are comparable to, or better than, the highest-quality determinations. Comparisons are presented for NGC 3384 and 4365, where stellar velocities and velocity dispersions are determined to a precision of 6 km s-1, and the h3 and h4 parameters of the line-of-sight velocity distribution to a precision of better than 0.02. Extraction of accurate gas emission-line intensities, velocities and linewidths from the data cubes is illustrated for NGC 5813. Comparisons with published line strengths for NGC 3384 and 5813 reveal uncertainties of [lsim]0.1 A on the measurements of the H{\{}beta{\}}, Mg b and Fe5270 indices. Integral-field mapping uniquely connects measurements of the kinematics and stellar populations to the galaxy morphology. The maps presented here illustrate the rich stellar kinematics, gaseous kinematics, and line-strength distributions of early-type galaxies. The results include the discovery of a thin, edge-on, disc in NGC 3623, confirm the axisymmetric shape of the central region of M32, illustrate the LINER nucleus and surrounding counter-rotating star-forming ring in NGC 7742, and suggest a uniform stellar population in the decoupled core galaxy NGC 5813.},

abstract = {We present absorption line strength maps of 48 representative elliptical and lenticular galaxies obtained as part of a survey of nearby galaxies using our custom-built integral-field spectrograph, SAURON, operating on the William Herschel Telescope. Using high-quality spectra, spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise ratio, we measure four key age, metallicity and abundance ratio sensitive indices from the Lick/IDS system over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately one effective radius. A discussion of calibrations and offsets is given, along with a description of error estimation and nebular emission correction. We modify the classical Fe5270 index to define a new index, Fe5270S, which maximizes the useable spatial coverage of SAURON. Maps of H{\{}beta{\}}, Fe5015, Mg b and Fe5270S are presented for each galaxy. We use the maps to compute average line strengths integrated over circular apertures of one-eighth effective radius, and compare the resulting relations of index versus velocity dispersion with previous long-slit work. The metal line strength maps show generally negative gradients with increasing radius roughly consistent with the morphology of the light profiles. Remarkable deviations from this general trend exist, particularly the Mg b isoindex contours appear to be flatter than the isophotes of the surface brightness for about 40 per cent of our galaxies without significant dust features. Generally, these galaxies exhibit significant rotation. We infer from this that the fast-rotating component features a higher metallicity and/or an increased Mg/Fe ratio as compared to the galaxy as a whole. The H{\{}beta{\}} maps are typically flat or show a mild positive outwards radial gradient, while a few galaxies show strong central peaks and/or elevated overall H{\{}beta{\}} strength likely connected to recent star formation activity. For the most prominent post-starburst galaxies, even the metal line strength maps show a reversed gradient.},

abstract = {We present observations of the stellar and gas kinematics for a representative sample of 24 Sa galaxies obtained with our custom-built integral-field spectrograph SAURON operating on the William Herschel Telescope. The data have been homogeneously reduced and analysed by means of a dedicated pipeline. All resulting data cubes were spatially binned to a minimum mean signal-to-noise ratio of 60 per spatial and spectral resolution element. Our maps typically cover the bulge-dominated region. We find a significant fraction of kinematically decoupled components (12/24), many of them displaying central velocity dispersion minima. They are mostly aligned and co-rotating with the main body of the galaxies, and are usually associated with dust discs and rings detected in unsharp-masked images. Almost all the galaxies in the sample (22/24) contain significant amounts of ionized gas which, in general, is accompanied by the presence of dust. The kinematics of the ionized gas are consistent with circular rotation in a disc co-rotating with respect to the stars. The distribution of mean misalignments between the stellar and gaseous angular momenta in the sample suggests that the gas has an internal origin. The [O III]/H{\{}beta{\}} ratio is usually very low, indicative of current star formation, and shows various morphologies (ring-like structures, alignments with dust lanes or amorphous shapes). The star formation rates (SFRs) in the sample are comparable with that of normal disc galaxies. Low gas velocity dispersion values appear to be linked to regions of intense star formation activity. We interpret this result as stars being formed from dynamically cold gas in those regions. In the case of NGC 5953, the data suggest that we are witnessing the formation of a kinematically decoupled component from cold gas being acquired during the ongoing interaction with NGC 5954.},

Galaxies in our sample probe the elliptical E, lenticular S0 and spiral Sa populations in the nearby Universe, both in field and cluster environments. We perform aperture photometry to derive homogeneous structural quantities. In combination with the SAURON stellar velocity dispersion measured within an effective radius ({\{}sigma{\}}e), this allows us to explore the location of our galaxies in the colour-magnitude, colour-{\{}sigma{\}}e, Kormendy, Faber-Jackson and Fundamental Plane scaling relations. We investigate the dependence of these relations on our recent kinematical classification of early-type galaxies (i.e. slow/fast rotators) and the stellar populations. Slow rotator and fast rotator E/S0 galaxies do not populate distinct locations in the scaling relations, although slow rotators display a smaller intrinsic scatter. We find that Sa galaxies deviate from the colour-magnitude and colour-{\{}sigma{\}}e relations due to the presence of dust, while the E/S0 galaxies define tight relations. Surprisingly, extremely young objects do not display the bluest (V-[3.6]) colours in our sample, as is usually the case in optical colours. This can be understood in the context of the large contribution of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars to the infrared, even for young populations, resulting in a very tight (V-[3.6])-{\{}sigma{\}}e relation that in turn allows us to define a strong correlation between metallicity and {\{}sigma{\}}e. Many Sa galaxies appear to follow the Fundamental Plane defined by E/S0 galaxies. Galaxies that appear offset from the relations correspond mostly to objects with extremely young populations, with signs of ongoing, extended star formation. We correct for this effect in the Fundamental Plane, by replacing luminosity with stellar mass using an estimate of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, so that all galaxies are part of a tight, single relation. The new estimated coefficients are consistent in both photometric bands and suggest that differences in stellar populations account for about half of the observed tilt with respect to the virial prediction. After these corrections, the slow rotator family shows almost no intrinsic scatter around the best-fitting Fundamental Plane. The use of a velocity dispersion within a small aperture (e.g. Re/8) in the Fundamental Plane results in an increase of around 15 per cent in the intrinsic scatter and an average 10 per cent decrease in the tilt away from the virial relation.},

abstract = {Following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas in early-type galaxies, we now address the question of what is powering the observed nebular emission. To constrain the likely sources of gas excitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data we draw from complementary information on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potential from the SAURON data, and use the SAURON-specific diagnostic diagram juxtaposing the [O III]{\{}lambda{\}}5007/H{\{}beta{\}} and [N I]{\{}lambda{\}}{\{}lambda{\}}5197, 5200/H{\{}beta{\}} line ratios. We find a tight correlation between the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the H{\{}beta{\}} recombination line across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as the main contributor of ionizing photons in early-type galaxies, with post-asymptotic giant branch (pAGB) stars being still the best candidate based on ionizing balance arguments. The role of AGN photoionization is confined to the central 2-3 arcsec of an handful of objects with radio or X-ray cores. OB-stars are the dominant source of photoionization in 10 per cent of the SAURON sample, whereas for another 10 per cent the intense and highly ionized emission is powered by the pAGB population associated to a recently formed stellar subcomponent. Fast shocks are not an important source of ionization for the diffuse nebular emission of early-type galaxies since the required shock velocities can hardly be attained in the potential of our sample galaxies. Finally, in the most massive and slowly or non-rotating galaxies in our sample, which can retain a massive X-ray halo, the finding of a spatial correlation between the hot and warm phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) suggests that the interaction with the hot ISM provides an additional source of ionization besides old ultraviolet-bright stars. This is also supported by a distinct pattern towards lower values of the [O III]/H{\{}beta{\}} ratio. These results lead us to investigate the relative role of stellar and AGN photoionization in explaining the ionized gas emission observed in early-type galaxies by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By simulating how our sample galaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the SDSS, we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the SDSS galaxies which display modest values for the equivalent width of the [O III] line (less than [{\~{}}]2.4 A) and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region like [O III]/H{\{}beta{\}} values the nebular emission is truly powered by an AGN.},

abstract = {Winds blown from collapsar accretion 
disks may produce observable stellar explosions independent of any GRB‐(and afterglow)‐producing jets which may be simultaneously produced. The production of winds is controlled by the accretion 
disk physics, in particular, the nature of disk cooling via neutrino emission and photo‐disintegration of heavy nuclei. These temperature‐dependent processes depend on the stellar angular momentum via the depth of the gravitational potential at the Kepler radius where the disk forms. Wind‐driven stellar explosions which do not make a GRB (or only a faint one) may occur and constitute a new class of supernova 
explosion. SN1998bw and 1997ef may be examples. A key feature of collapsar winds is that they are capable of producing the radioactive 56
Ni necessary to power a supernova light curve. It is possible to make a GRB in a star without significant production of 56
Ni. Such a star would not make an observable supernova and no such component would be expected in the light curve of the optical afterglow.},

For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

In a collapsing star, this black hole can form in two ways: the direct collapse of the stellar core into a black hole and the delayed collapse of a black hole caused by fallback in a weak supernova explosion. In the case of a delayed-collapse black hole, the strong collapsar-driven explosion overtakes the weak supernova explosion before shock breakout, and it is very difficult to distinguish this black hole formation scenario from the direct-collapse scenario. However, the delayed-collapse mechanism, with its double explosion, produces explosive nucleosynthetic yields that are very different from those in the direct-collapse scenario. We present one-dimensional studies of the nucleosynthetic yields from both black hole formation scenarios, deriving differences and trends in their nucleosynthetic yields.},

abstract = {GRB060505 and GRB060614 are nearby long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) without accompanying supernovae (SNe) down to very strict limits. They thereby challenge the conventional LGRB-SN connection and naturally give rise to the question: are there other peculiar features in their afterglows which would help shed light on their progenitors? To answer this question, we combine new observational data with published data and investigate the multi-band temporal and spectral properties of the two afterglows. We find that both afterglows can be well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shock wave model, and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well within the range observed for other LGRBs. Hence, from the properties of the afterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have another progenitor than other LGRBs. Recently, Swift-discovered GRB080503 also has the spike + tail structure during its prompt gamma-ray emission seemingly similar to GRB060614. We analyse the prompt emission of this burst and find that this GRB is actually a hard-spike + hard-tail burst with a spectral lag of 0.8{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.4 s during its tail emission. Thus, the properties of the prompt emission of GRB060614 and GRB080503 are clearly different, motivating further thinking of GRB classification. Finally we note that, whereas the progenitor of the two SN-less bursts remains uncertain, the core-collapse origin for the SN-less bursts would be quite certain if a wind-like environment can be observationally established, e.g, from an optical decay faster than the X-ray decay in the afterglow's slow cooling phase.},

How jet physics scales from stellar black holes in GRBs to the supermassive ones in AGN is still unknown. Here, we show that jets produced by AGN and GRBs exhibit the same correlation between the kinetic power carried by accelerated particles and the gamma-ray luminosity, with AGN and GRBs lying at the low- and high-luminosity ends, respectively, of the correlation. This result implies that the efficiency of energy dissipation in jets produced in black hole systems is similar over 10 orders of magnitude in jet power, establishing a physical analogy between AGN and GRBs.},

The derived total energy, E0 {\~{}} 5 × 1050 ergs, is well below the {\~{}}5 × 1051 ergs inferred under the assumption of spherical symmetry from gamma-ray and early afterglow observations. A natural consequence of this result, which can also account for deviations at t {\textless} 100 days from the spherical relativistic fireball model predictions, is that the fireball was initially a wide-angle jet of opening angle {\~{}}30°. Our analysis also allows determination of the energy fractions carried by the electrons and magnetic field and the density of the ambient medium surrounding the fireball. We find that during the subrelativistic expansion, the electrons and magnetic field are close to equipartition and the density of the ambient medium is {\~{}}1 cm -3.

abstract = {We present optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of the afterglow of GRB 120521C. By modeling the multi-wavelength data set, we derive a photometric redshift of z ≈ 6.0, which we confirm with a low signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the afterglow. We find that a model with a constant-density environment provides a good fit to the afterglow data, with an inferred density of n ≲ 0.05 cm{\^{}}−3. The radio observations reveal the presence of a jet break at t{\_}jet ≈ 7 d, corresponding to a jet opening angle of $\theta${\_}jet ≈ 3°. The beaming-corrected $\gamma$-ray and kinetic energies are E{\_}$\gamma$ ≈ E{\_}K ≈ 3 × 10{\^{}}50 erg. We quantify the uncertainties in our results using a detailed Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, which allows us to uncover degeneracies between the physical parameters of the explosion. To compare GRB 120521C to other high-redshift bursts in a uniform manner we re-fit all available afterglow data for the two other bursts at z gsim 6 with radio detections (GRBs 050904 and 090423). We find a jet break at t{\_}jet ≈ 15 d for GRB 090423, in contrast to previous work. Based on these three events, we find that $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) at z ≳ 6 appear to explode in constant-density environments, and exhibit a wide range of energies and densities that span the range inferred for lower redshift bursts. On the other hand, we find a hint for narrower jets in the z ≳ 6 bursts, potentially indicating a larger true event rate at these redshifts. Overall, our results indicate that long GRBs share a common progenitor population at least to z {\~{}} 8.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful explosions known in the Universe. Since their discovery in the early 1970s, they have been the subject of intense study but have defied detailed explanation. It is believed that supernovae and gamma-ray bursts may be related phenomena. This book brings together scientists working on supernovae and gamma-ray bursts to explore this connection and forge a new understanding. It includes invited reviews by leading experts in both fields who gathered at the Space Telescope Science Institute. It provides a comprehensive review of observations (ranging from gamma-rays to the radio) and theoretical models of supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, and a fascinating exploration of the possible links between the two classes of objects. It also critically examines the use of Type Ia supernovae for measuring the size of the Universe, and recent evidence for a cosmological constant. This volume provides a unique and stimulating reference for all students and researchers interested in supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and the relationship between them.},

This phenomenology can either be due to an intrinsically short-lived engine or to different progenitor properties between relativistic SNe and GRBs.},

abstract = {The double explosion of SN 2009ip in 2012 raises questions about our understanding of the late stages of massive star evolution. Here we present a comprehensive study of SN 2009ip during its remarkable rebrightenings. High-cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations from the GeV to the radio band obtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including the Very Large Array, Swift, Fermi, Hubble Space Telescope, and XMM) constrain SN 2009ip to be a low energy (E {\~{}} 1050 erg for an ejecta mass {\~{}}0.5 M ☉) and asymmetric explosion in a complex medium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. Most of the energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a dense shell of material located at {\~{}}5 × 1014 cm with M {\~{}} 0.1 M ☉, ejected by the precursor outburst {\~{}}40 days before the major explosion. We interpret the NIR excess of emission as signature of material located further out, the origin of which has to be connected with documented mass-loss episodes in the previous years. Our modeling predicts bright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic-ray energy is comparable to the radiated energy. We connect this phenomenology with the explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, which later interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previous eruptions. Future observations will reveal if the massive luminous progenitor star survived. Irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal, SN 2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodic mass loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.},

abstract = {We systematically reanalyzed all gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow data published through the end of 2002 in an attempt to detect the predicted supernova light component and to gain statistical insight into its phenomenological properties. We fit the observed photometric light curves as the sum of an afterglow, an underlying host galaxy, and a supernova component. The latter is modeled using published multicolor light curves of SN 1998bw as a template. The total sample of afterglows with established redshifts contains 21 bursts (GRB 970228-GRB 021211). For nine of these GRBs a weak supernova excess (scaled to SN 1998bw) was found, which is what makes this one of the first samples of high-z core-collapse supernovae. Among this sample are all bursts with redshifts less than {\~{}}0.7. These results strongly support the notion that in fact all afterglows of long-duration GRBs contain light from an associated supernova. A statistics of the physical parameters of these GRB-supernovae shows that SN 1998bw was at the bright end of its class, while it was not special with respect to its light-curve shape. Finally, we have searched for a potential correlation of the supernova luminosities with the properties of the corresponding bursts and optical afterglows, but we have not found such a relation.},

abstract = {When massive stars exhaust their fuel, they collapse and often produce the extraordinarily bright explosions known as core-collapse supernovae. On occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic explosion known as a long-duration gamma-ray burst. One would then expect that these long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find that the gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated in the very brightest regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae. Together these results suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are associated with the most extremely massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of limited chemical evolution. Our results directly imply that long gamma-ray bursts are relatively rare in galaxies such as our own Milky Way.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)--including the subclass of X-ray flashes (XRFs)--have been revealed to be a rare variety of type Ibc supernova. Although all these events result from the death of massive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of GRBs and XRFs exceed those of ordinary type Ibc supernovae by many orders of magnitude. The essential physical process that causes a dying star to produce a GRB or XRF, and not just a supernova, is still unknown. Here we report radio and X-ray observations of XRF 060218 (associated with supernova SN 2006aj), the second-nearest GRB identified until now. We show that this event is a hundred times less energetic but ten times more common than cosmological GRBs. Moreover, it is distinguished from ordinary type Ibc supernovae by the presence of 10(48) erg coupled to mildly relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine (an accretion-fed, rapidly rotating compact source) that produces X-rays for weeks after the explosion. This suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the key physical distinction between GRBs or XRFs and ordinary supernovae, while the nature of the central engine (black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts from low-luminosity, spherical events like XRF 060218.},

abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with type Ic supernovae that are more luminous than average and that eject material at very high velocities. Less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associated with GRBs, and therefore GRB-supernovae were thought to be rare events. Whether X-ray flashes--analogues of GRBs, but with lower luminosities and fewer gamma-rays--can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they are intrinsically 'weak' events or typical GRBs viewed off the axis of the burst, is unclear. Here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations of the type Ic supernova SN 2006aj associated with X-ray flash XRF 060218. Supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the GRB-supernovae, but more luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a GRB. The ejecta velocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups, which is consistent with the weakness of both the GRB output and the supernova radio flux. Our data, combined with radio and X-ray observations, suggest that XRF 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical GRB observed off-axis. This extends the GRB-supernova connection to X-ray flashes and fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. Events such as XRF 060218 are probably more numerous than GRB-supernovae.},

This evidence was originally based on the probable association of one unusual GRB with a supernova, but now includes the association of GRBs with regions of massive star formation in distant galaxies, the appearance of supernova-like 'bumps' in the optical afterglow light curves of several bursts and lines of freshly synthesized elements in the spectra of a few X-ray afterglows. These observations support, but do not yet conclusively demonstrate, the idea that long-duration GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, presumably arising from core collapse. Here we report evidence that a very energetic supernova (a hypernova) was temporally and spatially coincident with a GRB at redshift z = 0.1685. The timing of the supernova indicates that it exploded within a few days of the GRB, strongly suggesting that core-collapse events can give rise to GRBs, thereby favouring the 'collapsar' model.},

Here we report the discovery of transient optical emission in the error box of the -ray burst GRB980425, the light curve of which was very different from that of previous optical afterglows associated with -ray bursts. The optical transient is located in a spiral arm of the galaxy ESO184-G82, which has a redshift velocity of only 2,550 km s-1 (ref. 6). Its optical spectrum and location indicate that it is a very luminous supernova7, which has been identified as SN1998bw. If this supernova and GRB980425 are indeed associated, the energy radiated in -rays is at least four orders of magnitude less than in other -ray bursts, although its appearance was otherwise unremarkable: this indicates that very different mechanisms can give rise to -ray bursts.

abstract = {The radio emission from supernovae has been modeled as synchrotron emission from the interaction between the supernova and a presupernova stellar wind. The emission shows a late power-law decline and early rise due to a low-frequency absorption process, which, in some cases (SN 1979C and SN 1980K), is well modeled as free-free absorption by the external wind. However, the flux rises in many radio supernovae (e.g., SN 1987A and Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae) have not been sufficiently well observed to define the absorption mechanism. The assumption of synchrotron self-absorption yields an approximate radius of the emission region at the time of peak flux. If another mechanism is dominant, the radius must be even larger. The large radii implied for SN 1987A and the observed Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae make external free-free absorption unlikely, given what else is known about these systems, so that synchrotron self-absorption is the probable absorption mechanism. Synchrotron self-absorption may play a role in the radio emission from SN 1981K (type unknown) and SN 1978K (Type IIn). Model supernova light curves with synchrotron self-absorption are presented. A combination of synchrotron self-absorption and external free-free absorption may be relevant to SN 1993J. The radii implied for the Type II supernovae SN 1979C and SN 1980K in the synchrotron self-absorption model are smaller than the radii expected for circumstellar interaction and are thus consistent with the free-free absorption mechanism.},

abstract = {Properties of self-similar solutions with varying power law exponents describing the interaction of an expanding supernova with the circumstellar medium created by presupernova mass loss are examined. The outflowing material comprises an inner shell of shocked ejecta and an outer shell of shocked ambient gas. Similarity variables are developed for the inner region and boundary conditions are defined for numerical solution. The pressure is assumed to be continuous at the contact discontinuity between the two regions and self-similar solutions yield the thicknesses of the two shells. Applications are made to the cases of Type I and II supernovae, showing that thin shells form initially which are over 300 times the ambient density, but optical emissions occur only when lumps of material are present in the shocked gas before the shock arrives. The self-similar solutions are found to be accurate if the expanding matter has a power-law distribution.},

abstract = {Dwarf satellite galaxies are thought to be the remnants of the population of primordial structures that coalesced to form giant galaxies like the Milky Way. It has previously been suspected that dwarf galaxies may not be isotropically distributed around our Galaxy, because several are correlated with streams of H I emission, and may form coplanar groups. These suspicions are supported by recent analyses. It has been claimed that the apparently planar distribution of satellites is not predicted within standard cosmology, and cannot simply represent a memory of past coherent accretion. However, other studies dispute this conclusion. Here we report the existence of a planar subgroup of satellites in the Andromeda galaxy (M 31), comprising about half of the population. The structure is at least 400 kiloparsecs in diameter, but also extremely thin, with a perpendicular scatter of less than 14.1 kiloparsecs. Radial velocity measurements reveal that the satellites in this structure have the same sense of rotation about their host. This shows conclusively that substantial numbers of dwarf satellite galaxies share the same dynamical orbital properties and direction of angular momentum. Intriguingly, the plane we identify is approximately aligned with the pole of the Milky Way's disk and with the vector between the Milky Way and Andromeda.},

@article{Klypin1999,
abstract = {According to the hierarchical clustering scenario, galaxies are assembled by merging and accretion of numerous satellites of different sizes and masses. This ongoing process is not 100{\%} efficient in destroying all of the accreted satellites, as evidenced by the satellites of our Galaxy and of M31. Using published data, we have compiled the circular velocity (Vcirc) distribution function (VDF) of galaxy satellites in the Local Group. We find that within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400 h-1 kpc assuming the Hubble constant h = 0.7) centered on the Milky Way and Andromeda, the average VDF is roughly approximated as n({\textgreater} Vcirc) ≈ 55 ± 11(Vcirc/10 km s-1)-1.4±0.4 h3 Mpc-3 for Vcirc in the range ≈10-70 km s-1. The observed VDF is compared with results of high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that the VDF in models is very different from the observed one: n({\textgreater} Vcirc) ≈ 1200(Vcirc/10 km s-1)-2.75 h3 Mpc-3. Cosmological models thus predict that a halo the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter satellites with circular velocity greater than 20 km s-1 and mass greater than 3 × 108 M☉ within a 570 kpc radius. This number is significantly higher than the approximately dozen satellites actually observed around our Galaxy. The difference is even larger if we consider the abundance of satellites in simulated galaxy groups similar to the Local Group. The models predict {\~{}}300 satellites inside a 1.5 Mpc radius, while only {\~{}}40 satellites are observed in the Local Group. The observed and predicted VDFs cross at ≈50 km s-1, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites with Vcirc  50 km s-1 is in reasonably good agreement with observations. We conclude, therefore, that unless a large fraction of the Local Group satellites has been missed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observations and hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of some satellites with the high-velocity clouds observed in the Local Group and the existence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars either because of the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or because of gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing background.},

In order to characterise the phenomenology associated to such models, we extend previous investigations by studying the most general case of a relativistic BEC on a curved background including a non-minimal coupling to curvature. In particular, we discuss the possibility of a two phase cosmological evolution: a cold dark matter-like phase at the large scales/early times and a condensed phase inside dark matter halos. During the first phase dark matter is described by a minimally coupled weakly self-interacting scalar field, while in the second one dark matter condensates and, we shall argue, develops as a consequence the non-minimal coupling. Finally, we discuss how such non-minimal coupling could provide a new mechanism to address cold dark matter paradigm issues at galactic scales.},

abstract = {We present the HI data for 5 spiral galaxies that, along with their Halpha rotation curves, are used to derive the distribution of dark matter within these objects. A new method for extracting rotation curves from HI data cubes is presented; this takes into account the existence of a warp and minimises projection effects. The rotation curves obtained are tested by taking them as input to construct model data cubes that are compared to the observed ones: the agreement is excellent. On the contrary, the model data cubes built using rotation curves obtained with standard methods, such as the first-moment analysis, fail the test. The HI rotation curves agree well with the Halpha data, where they coexist. Moreover, the combined Halpha + HI rotation curves are smooth, symmetric and extended to large radii.   The rotation curves are decomposed into stellar, gaseous and dark matter contributions and the inferred density distribution is compared to various mass distributions: dark haloes with a central density core, {\$}\backslashLambda{\$} Cold Dark Matter ({\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM) haloes (NFW, Moore profiles), HI scaling and MOND. The observations point to haloes with constant density cores of size {\$}r{\_}{\{}core{\}} \backslashsim r{\_}{\{}opt{\}}{\$} and central densities scaling approximately as {\$}\backslashrho{\_}0 \backslashpropto r{\_}{\{}core{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2/3{\}}{\$}. {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM models (which predict a central cusp in the density profile) are in clear conflict with the data.

abstract = {Two well studied dwarf galaxies -- NGC 3109 and NGC 6822 -- present some of the strongest observational support for a flat core at the center of galactic dark matter (DM) halos. We use detailed cosmologically motivated numerical models to investigate the systematics and the accuracy of recovering parameters of the galaxies. Some of our models match the observed structure of the two galaxies remarkably well. Our analysis shows that the rotation curves of these two galaxies are instead quite compatible with their DM halos having steep cuspy density profiles. The rotation curves in our models are measured using standard observational techniques. The models reproduce the rotation curves of both galaxies, the disk surface brightness profiles as well as the profile of isophotal ellipticity and position angle. The models are centrally dominated by baryons; however, the dark matter component is globally dominant. The simulated disk mass is marginally consistent with a stellar mass-to-light ratio in agreement with the observed colors. We show that non-circular motions combined with gas pressure support and projection effects results in a large underestimation of the circular velocity in the central {\$}\backslashsim 1{\$} kpc region, creating the illusion of a constant density core. Although the systematic effects mentioned above are stronger in barred systems, they are also present in axisymetric disks. Our results strongly suggest that there is no contradiction between the observed rotation curves in dwarf galaxies and the cuspy central dark matter density profiles predicted by Cold Dark Matter models.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short, intense flashes of soft gamma-rays coming from the distant Universe. Long-duration GRBs (those lasting more than approximately 2 s) are believed to originate from the deaths of massive stars, mainly on the basis of a handful of solid associations between GRBs and supernovae. GRB 060614, one of the closest GRBs discovered, consisted of a 5-s hard spike followed by softer, brighter emission that lasted for approximately 100 s (refs 8, 9). Here we report deep optical observations of GRB 060614 showing no emerging supernova with absolute visual magnitude brighter than M(V) = -13.7. Any supernova associated with GRB 060614 was therefore at least 100 times fainter, at optical wavelengths, than the other supernovae associated with GRBs. This demonstrates that some long-lasting GRBs can either be associated with a very faint supernova or produced by different phenomena.},

abstract = {It is now accepted that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced during the collapse of a massive star. The standard 'collapsar' model predicts that a broad-lined and luminous type Ic core-collapse supernova accompanies every long-duration GRB. This association has been confirmed in observations of several nearby GRBs. Here we report that GRB 060505 (ref. 10) and GRB 060614 (ref. 11) were not accompanied by supernova emission down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal supernova SN 1998bw that accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any type Ic supernova ever observed. Multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the host galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and show that the bursts originated in actively star-forming regions. The absence of a supernova to such deep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long-duration GRBs and suggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are known to come in two duration classes, separated at approximately 2 s. Long-duration bursts originate from star-forming regions in galaxies, have accompanying supernovae when these are near enough to observe and are probably caused by massive-star collapsars. Recent observations show that short-duration bursts originate in regions within their host galaxies that have lower star-formation rates, consistent with binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole mergers. Moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no supernovae have been so far associated with short-duration GRBs. Here we report that the bright, nearby GRB 060614 does not fit into either class. Its approximately 102-s duration groups it with long-duration GRBs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely within the short-duration GRB subclass. Moreover, very deep optical observations exclude an accompanying supernova, similar to short-duration GRBs. This combination of a long-duration event without an accompanying supernova poses a challenge to both the collapsar and the merging-neutron-star interpretations and opens the door to a new GRB classification scheme that straddles both long- and short-duration bursts.},

abstract = {This paper reports the latest results from a millimeter-wave (CO) spectroscopic survey of IRAS-detected radio galaxies with L1.4GHz{\~{}}1023-1028 W Hz-1 in the redshift range z{\~{}}0.02-0.15. The IRAS flux-limited sample contains 33 radio galaxies with different radio morphologies and a broad range of infrared luminosities (LIR=109-1012 Lsolar), allowing for an investigation of (1) whether low-z radio-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reside in molecular gas-rich host galaxies and (2) whether the CO properties are correlated with the properties of the host galaxy or the AGN. All of the radio galaxies in Mazzarella et al. and Mirabel et al. have been reobserved. Three new CO detections have been made, raising the total number of CO detections to nine and setting the survey detection rate at {\~{}}25{\%}. Many of the CO lines have double-peaked profiles, and the CO line widths are broad (average $\Delta$vFWHM{\~{}}500+/-130 km s-1), exceeding the average CO widths of both ultraluminous infrared galaxies (300+/-90 km s-1) and Palomar-Green QSOs (260+/-160 km s-1), and thus being indicative of massive host galaxies. The CO luminosities translate into molecular gas masses of {\~{}}(0.4-7)×109 Msolar, however, the 3 $\sigma$ CO upper limits for nondetections do not rule out a molecular gas mass as high as that of the Milky Way ({\~{}}3×109 Msolar). Optical images of eight out of nine molecular gas-rich radio galaxies show evidence of close companions and/or tidal features. Finally, there is no obvious correlation between radio power and molecular gas mass. However, it is notable that only one F-R II galaxy out of 12 is detected in this CO survey; the remaining detections are of galaxies hosting F-R I and compact radio jets.},

abstract = {We investigate the high-frequency radio spectra of 20 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) with compact radio cores. Our millimetre survey with the Nobeyama Millimetre Array (NMA) and analyses of submillimetre archival data that had been obtained with the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) reveal the following properties. At least half of the LLAGNs show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz; we use the published data at 15 GHz with the Very Large Array (VLA) in a 0.15-arcsec resolution and our measurements at 96 GHz with the NMA in a 7-arcsec resolution. The inverted spectra are not artificially made due to their unmatched beam sizes, because of little diffuse contamination from dust, H II regions, or extended jets in these LLAGNs. Such high-frequency inverted spectra are apparently consistent with a ‘submillimetre bump', which is predicted by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model. We find a strong correlation between the high-frequency spectral index and low-frequency core power measured with very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments. The inverted spectra are found exclusively in low-core-power sources, while steep spectra are in high-core-power ones with prominent pc-scale jets. This suggests that the ADAF and non-thermal jets may coexist. The flux ratios between disc and jet seem to be different from LLAGN to LLAGN; disc components can be seen in nuclear radio spectra only if the jets are faint.},
