\chapter{Ionized Gas Distribution, Kinematics and Ionization}
	\label{cha:gas}
The interstellar medium (ISM) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) has several components: a diffuse hot ($\sim 10^7 \, \mathrm{K}$) X-ray halo (with typical mass $10^8$\,--\,$10^{10} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$); a warm ($\sim 10^4 \, \mathrm{K}$) ionized gas component ($10^2$\,--\,$10^5 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$), which can be more clumpy; and cold ($<10^2 \, \mathrm{K}$) atomic and molecular gas ($10^6$\,--\,$10^8 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$), which is generally confined to small (kpc or less) clouds. In this chapter we study the spatially-resolved properties of the ionized gas component of radio galaxies (RGs), exploiting the emission lines in the VIMOS and MUSE datacubes of the Southern Sample.

Using the methods described in Section \ref{subsec:EmissionFit}, we find the best-fit line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD; assumed to be Gaussian and parametrised by the mean velocity and velocity dispersion only) of the emission lines in each bin. As described in \ref{subsec:EmissionFit}, all emission lines are fit with the same LOSVD, but each with its own flux. In the cases of the [\ion{O}{iii}], [\ion{O}{i}] and [\ion{N}{ii}] doublets, the two components of the doublets are fit with a fixed flux ratio of 1:0.34. The [\ion{N}{i}] doublet has a fixed ratio of 1:0.65 \citep{Safier1992}. The two components of the [\ion{O}{ii}] and [\ion{S}{ii}] doublets are fit independently.

This chapter is structured as follows. Firstly in Section \ref{sec:GasFlux} the flux and equivalent-width maps of each emission line in the respective wavelength range of VIMOS and MUSE are shown. Gas masses are calculated and upper limits estimated in the cases of non-detections (see Section \ref{sec:GasFlux}). Secondly, in Section \ref{sec:GasKin} the kinematics of the ionized gas is discussed. Thirdly, the likely sources of the gas ionization are investigated, making use of several emission line diagnostics (Section \ref{sec:Diagnostics}). The results for each galaxy in the Southern Sample are summarised in Table \ref{tab:gasMass}. Finally, we conclude in Section \ref{sec:gasDiscussion} with a discussion of the results of this chapter.

	\subsection{Maps}
		\label{subsec:GasMaps}
		Images of the Southern Sample galaxies in the [\ion{O}{iii}]$\lambda\lambda$4957,5007 lines are shown in Figs.\ \ref{fig:VIMOS_OIII} and \ref{fig:MUSE_OIII} (we choose to show [\ion{O}{iii}] as detections of all emission lines require a detection of [\ion{O}{iii}] first, see Section \ref{subsec:EmissionFit}). Only 4 galaxies of the Southern Sample have emission lines detected outside of their central region (IC 1459, NGC 612, NGC 1316 and NGC 3100; see Figs.\,\ref{fig:VIMOS_OIII} and \ref{fig:MUSE_OIII}). Of the remaining 7 galaxies, NGC 1399 and PKS 718-34 have no detection of H$\beta$ in their spatially-resolved map (although we do detect H$\beta$ in the spatially-integrated spectrum of NGC 1399; see Section \ref{subsec:GasMass}), while the other 5 galaxies are only detected in their centre. All other emission lines have similar distributions, but with different fluxes.

		As can be seen from Fig.\,\ref{fig:VIMOS_OIII}, both NGC 612 and NGC 3100 have significant off-centre clouds of ionized gas. The latter is spatial coincident with both the radio jet and the gap in the CO ring (this is discussed further in Section \ref{subsec:BPT}), while former seems to no link with either the radio jet (a massive scale jet extending several $\sim 200$\,kpc to the east and west of the galaxy centre) or the CO. 

	\subsection{Gas Masses}
		\label{subsec:GasMass}

		Total ionized gas masses are derived using the prescription of \citet{Sarzi2005}. This is a very rough calculation and the values should not be used for quantitative applications. The approach follows \citet{Kim1989}, whereby
		\begin{equation}
			\left(\frac{M_\text{\ion{H}{ii}}}{M_\odot}\right) = 280 \left(\frac{D}{10\, \mathrm{Mpc}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{F(\mathrm{H\alpha})}{10^{-14} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1} \, cm^{-2}}}\right) \left(\frac{10^3 \, \mathrm{cm^{-3}}}{n_\mathrm{e}}\right) \, ,
		\end{equation}
		where $M_\text{\ion{H}{ii}}$ is the total mass of \ion{H}{ii} in the galaxy, $D$ is the galaxy distance, and $F(\mathrm{H\alpha})$ is the H$\alpha$ flux measured from the spectrum created by summing spatially all spaxels within an aperture of $\frac{R_\mathrm{e}}{2}$ (chosen to exclude outer noisy regions of the observations, but include spatially extended gas regions). This method assumes an electron density $n_\mathrm{e} = 100 \, \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, a temperature of $10^4$ K and case-B recombination (electrons above 13.6\,eV are not reabsorbed; e.g.\ \citealt[p.\,74]{Osterbrock1974}). Like \citet{Sarzi2005}, we only claim a detection if the amplitude-to-noise ratio (A/N) is $>4$ for [\ion{O}{iii}] and $>2.5$ for H$\beta$ or H$\alpha$. Upper limits are calculated using the $1\sigma$ noise level (see Section \ref{subsec:EmissionFit}).

		Our calculated gas masses are given Table \ref{tab:gasMass} and are at the upper limit of, and possibly exceed, the typical masses observed in ETGs. Given that our sample contains particularly massive galaxies, high ionized gas masses are not unexpected, however.

\section{Ionized Gas Kinematics}
	\label{sec:GasKin}
	In Figs.\,\ref{fig:VIMOS_Gaskine} and \ref{fig:MUSE_Gaskine}, we show maps of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion of the ionized gas for the 4 galaxies with extended emission lines, IC 1459, NGC 612, NGC 1316 and NGC 3100. Due to that fact that, unlike stars, gas is dissipational, it is to be expected that given sufficient time, the ISM will always settle into a disc. These maps show that the ISM of the Southern sample galaxies varies from largely settled discs in IC 1459 and NGC 612 to more disordered kinematics of NGC 3100 and a possible inflow in NGC 1316.

	% \subsection{Misalignment of Gas}
	% 	\label{subsec:Gasmisaligment}
	It is immediately clear when comparing the mean stellar velocity maps (Figs.\,\ref{fig:VIMOS_stellar} and \ref{fig:MUSE_stellar}) to the mean gas velocity maps (Figs.\,\ref{fig:VIMOS_Gaskine} and \ref{fig:MUSE_Gaskine}) that where gas is detected, its angular momentum is not often aligned with that of the stars. A misalignment between the kinematics of the stars and gas suggests an external origin for the gas (e.g.\ accretion or wet merger). However it should be noted that the converses is not necessarily true: aligned kinematics is consistent with an internal origin (e.g.\ stellar-mass loss), but it does \emph{not} require it \citep[e.g.][]{Davis2011a}. 

	We now comment on each galaxy in turn.

	\paragraph{IC 1459} has ionized gas counter-rotating with respect to the stellar kinematically-decoupled core, and also rotating independently from the rest of the galaxy. \citet{Franx1988} claim that the rotation of the gas is aligned with that of the stars outside of the KDC, however we observe outer stellar kinematics to be non-rotating. As the stellar disc did not survive the merger even that created the KDC, it is unlikely that the gas in IC 1459 progenitor galaxy survived. The lost gas may, however, have been re-accreted. Alternatively, the ISM may have yet another external origin. 

	\paragraph{NGC 612} has well aligned stellar and gaseous kinematics. The misalignment between the position angle of the stellar and gas kinematics (using the method described in Section \ref{subsec:Misalignment}) is just $1\fdg0\pm0\fdg7$, consistent with an internal origin for the gas. This adds to the evidence (see Appendix \ref{cha:Description}) that NGC 612 has not undergone a major merger (major mergers exhaust galaxies of their gas and destroy a stellar disc; see Section \ref{sec:stellarDiscussion}) and suggests that, the fueling and powering of the radio jet must be a purely secular process. 


	\paragraph{NGC 1316} is a complex object. Since there are redshifted emission lines with respect to the rest frame of the galaxy on both sides of the galaxy, the gas is not in a settled disc and that there must be some inflow/outflows. We used a fitting routine based on the method of \citet{Swinbank2012}, \citet{Stott2016} and Tiley et.al.\ (in prep.) to fit an exponential disc (middle panel of Fig.\ \ref{fig:Inflow}) to the ionized gas mean velocity map (left panel), with the residuals shown in the right panel of Fig.\ \ref{fig:Inflow}. This shows a large residual on the southwest side of the galaxy, which we interpret as an inflow towards the nucleus, almost perpendicular to the radio jet. However, there are still significant residuals in other parts of the galaxy, suggesting that the model may not be a good representation of the reality of the galaxy, thus other interpretations are possible, and better quality data (longer exposure times) are required to add certainty to this interpretation. Nevertheless, it is clear that the gas in not in a settled disc.

A large region, redshifted with respect to the galaxy, can be seen in the southwest which we interpret as an inflow. Contours are as in Fig.\ \ref{fig:VIMOS_OIII}.}
		\label{fig:Inflow}
	\end{figure}


	\paragraph{NGC 3100} has an interesting ISM morphology. The \ce{^{12}CO(2-1)} contours (shown in cyan in all figures) show a broken ring with the radio jet passing through the gaps in the ring (Ruffa et\,al., in prep.). We observe the ionized gas to be brightest in the gaps of this ring which we interpret as additional excitation of the gas due to shocks from the impact of the jet (discussed in more detail in Section \ref{subsec:BPT}). The simplest comment that we can make of the ionized gas kinematics is that it is completely different than that of the stars. Secondly, that the centre of rotation of the gas appears to be offset from the centre of the galaxy (as defined by the stellar surface brightness) by several arcseconds to the west. 

	\subsection{Kinematic mis-alignments}
		\citet{Davis2011a} showed that $36\pm5$\% of fast rotators have ionized gas kinematics misaligned with respect to the stellar kinematics, while slow rotators have a flat distribution with respect to their misalignment angles \citep[see fig.\ 4]{Davis2011a}. This indicates that slow rotators are dominated by external sources of gas, while fast rotators can have either internal or external sources. This is consistent with our observations of the Southern Sample: the only slow rotator with detected ionized gas is IC 1459, which has significantly kinematically-misaligned gas; of the 3 fast rotators, only 1 (NGC 3100) is definitely misaligned, while NGC 612 is consistent with an internal gas origin and NGC 1316 is not clear, although the best-fit exponential disc model (see Fig.\ \ref{fig:Inflow}) is definitely misaligned to the stellar kinematics.

\section{Ionization Sources}
	\label{sec:Diagnostics}
	Determining the sources of ionizing radiation in galaxies using emission line ratios, such as Baldwin\,--\,Phillips\,--\,Terlevich (BPT) plots (\citealt{Baldwin1981}; revised by \citealt{Kewley2001, Kewley2006} and \citealt{Kauffmann2003a}), has become increasingly widespread exercise. That said, there are several important caveats. Firstly, great care must be taken when applying each diagnostic; much of the literature misinterprets the resulting classifications. Secondly, in the absence of spatially-resolved spectra, low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) classifications have often been taken as a marker for jet-mode active galactic nuclei (AGN). As discussed in Section \ref{subsubsec:JetFeedback} however, several recent surveys have shown that many of these may not be bona fide AGN \citep[e.g.][]{Sarzi2005, Sarzi2010, Singh2013, Belfiore2016a}. In these cases, the emission may not even originate exclusively from the centres of the galaxies, the location of the putative AGN. This led to the creation of the low-ionization emission-line region (LIER) classification, with the same criteria as LINERs, but not necessarily restricted to the nuclear regions.

	The problem with classifying ETGs by their emission lines is that they often have very little ionized gas and weak ionizing radiation fields, so that it is often difficult to detect emission lines from their ISM. Furthermore, the BPT plots require a larger spectral range than many integral-field spectrographs (IFS) deliver. This has given rise to a number of other, analogous, classifying plots, that we take advantage of here. A description of our ionization source classifying process follows below. 

	Firstly, we preferentially use the BPT plots for the galaxies observed with MUSE (that has the required spectral range; see Section \ref{subsec:BPT}). This allows us to classify galaxies into star-forming, LINER/LIER or Seyfert 2 classes. For the emission-line fluxes derived from the VIMOS datacubes, we use the [\ion{N}{i}]/H$\beta$ versus [\ion{O}{iii}]/H$\beta$ plot of \citet[hereafter the SAURON plot]{Sarzi2010}. Unlike the BPT plots, \citet{Sarzi2010} do not define classification boundaries. We use the Balmer decrement (see Section \ref{subsec:Ndec}) and the [\ion{N}{i}] flux versus [\ion{N}{ii}] flux relation (Section \ref{subsec:Ndec}) to convert the [\ion{N}{ii}]/H$\alpha$ BPT plot classification boundaries of \citet{Kewley2001} and \citet{Kauffmann2003a} to the [\ion{N}{i}]/H$\beta$ SAURON plot (as described in more detail in Section \ref{subsec:Ndec}). This allows us to classify galaxies into star-forming or LINER/Seyfert 2 classes. We also use the so-called WHaN2 plot (H$\alpha$ equivalent width versus [\ion{N}{ii}]/H$\alpha$; see Section \ref{subsec:WHaN2}) from \citet{CidFernandes2011}. Using the same method as above, we again transform this plot into a H$\beta$ equivalent width versus [\ion{N}{i}]/H$\beta$ (WHbN1) plot for the VIMOS data. To transform the equivalent widths of H$\alpha$ to H$\beta$, we find the continuum at H$\alpha$, $C_\text{6563\AA}$, and plot it against the continuum at H$\beta$, $C_\text{4861\AA}$ (again described in more detail in Section \ref{subsec:Ndec}). This allows us to classify galaxies into star-forming, strong AGN (Seyfert 2), weak AGN (LINER) or retired classes. 

	To check if the LINER classifications are due to a central radiation source (such as an AGN) or extended sources (such as weak star formation or post-asymptotic giant branch stars; pAGB stars), we examine the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ flux radial profiles of our galaxies with extended detected ionized gas (Section \ref{subsec:Hb}). Finally, in Section \ref{subsec:MEx} we use the mass\,--\,excitation (MEx) plot of \cite{Nyland2016}, using parameters derived from the central region of the galaxies, only measured within a 3$^{\prime\prime}$ wide aperture. This allows us to classify into star-forming, Seyfert 2, LINER, transition or passive classes, with LINER galaxies subdivided into those whose LINER behaviour is (LINER-AGN) or is not attributed to a central AGN.

		\end{figure}

		The Balmer decrement, $d_\mathrm{H}$, is the ratio of the H$\alpha$ to H$\beta$ fluxes. There are good theoretical motivations for this ratio to be near constant at $d_\mathrm{H} = 2.86$, under a wide variety of conditions. In reality, however, higher values are routinely observed. These can be explained as due to either the presence of dust causing extinction (whereby emission lines at shorter wavelengths appear dimmer than expected from their redder counterparts due to dust preferentially scattering and absorbing bluer light) or some mechanism that populates hydrogen levels from the ground up. Such mechanisms may be important in high-density environments, such as within powerful (type 1) AGN \citep[e.g.][]{Shields1974, Netzer1975}. 
		%
		% The majority ($\approx 60$\%) of ETGs and all LINER and Seyfert galaxies are dusty \citep[e.g.][]{Martini2013}. 
		% Such galaxies reveal clear dust lanes in \textit{Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} observations \citep[e.g.][]{Martini2013}, are bright in the infrared (where the thermal emission from dust is seen as a dust ``bump''; e.g.\ \citealt{Jura1987, Knapp1992}), and possess other emission lines \citep[e.g.\ \bracket{\ion{S}{ii}};][]{Wampler1968} showing similar reddening. Thus, assuming the observed steepening of the Balmer decrement is entirely due to dust, the ratio of the observed decrement to the theoretical value of 2.86 is a good estimate of the dust reddening.

		If we assume that different ionization states of a given atomic species occur in the same spatial location, then shielding is not important or at least is not non-linear in its effect on the emission-line ratios. Given that the different states are then produced under the same conditions, it is natural to expect a simple relationship between their emission line fluxes, similar to the Balmer decrement. We exploit such relationships to transform classification boundaries from diagnostic plots which use emission lines outside of the spectral range of VIMOS to diagnostics which can be measured with our VIMOS data e.g.\ transform from the classic BPT [\ion{N}{ii}]/H$\alpha$ versus [\ion{O}{iii}]/H$\beta$ to [\ion{N}{i}]/H$\beta$ versus [\ion{O}{iii}]/H$\beta$ diagnostic plot (hereafter the SAURON diagnostic plot) of \citet{Sarzi2010}. We achieve this by finding a best-fit relationship between the relevant measurements taken in each bin of the galaxies for which we have the relevant detections in our MUSE data (due to the lack of detectable emission line in the observations of IC 4296 and NGC 1399, we therefore use the observations of IC 1459 and NGC 1316). This relationship is then applied to the diagnostic boundary lines in the relevant plots below. We emphasize that these are purely empirical relationships and thus differ substantially from the Balmer decrement with its strong theoretical basis (although these relationships include the effect of the Balmer decrement). 

		The two transformations that we use are from [\ion{N}{ii}]/H$\alpha$ to [\ion{N}{i}]/H$\beta$ line ratios and from the H$\alpha$ to the H$\beta$ equivalent widths. In both cases we fit a linear relationship $y = Ax + B$ using the least-trimmed squares routine, \textsc{lts\_linefit}\footnote{http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/\~mxc/software/\#lts} of \citet{Cappellari2013} due to its robust handling of the uncertainties along both axes. These are shown in Figs.\ \ref{fig:ratio_relation} and \ref{fig:EqW_relation}, where we find
		\begin{align}
			\frac{[\text{\ion{N}{ii}}]}{H\alpha} & = \, (0.38 \pm 0.02) \frac{[\text{\ion{N}{i}}]}{H\beta} + (1.80 \pm 0.02)
				\label{eq:N_dec}
			\intertext{and}
			\mathrm{EW}(H\alpha) & = \, (2.92 \pm 0.03) \mathrm{EW}(H\beta) - (0.16 \pm 0.02) \, ,
				\label{eq:EqW_dec}
			\intertext{respectively. Since it is sometimes observed that [\ion{N}{ii}]/H$\alpha < 1.80$, which if blindly applying the relationship found above, results in an unphysical [\ion{N}{i}]/H$\beta < 0$ (i.e.\ negative flux), we instead rearrange and use}
			\frac{[\text{\ion{N}{i}}]}{H\beta} & = \, 
			\begin{cases}
				(0.38 \pm 0.02) \frac{[\text{\ion{N}{iI}}]}{H\alpha} + (1.80 \pm 0.02), & \text{if}\ \frac{[\text{\ion{N}{ii}}]}{H\alpha} < 2 \\
				(0.38 \pm 0.02) \frac{[\text{\ion{N}{ii}}]}{H\alpha}, & \text{otherwise.}
			\end{cases}
		\end{align}


	\subsection{BPT Diagnostics}
		\label{subsec:BPT}
		Firstly, in Fig.\,\ref{fig:BPT}, we examine our galaxies using the classic BPT diagnostic plots. For the plots using [\ion{N}{ii}]/H$\alpha$, [\ion{S}{ii}]/H$\alpha$ and [\ion{O}{i}]/H$\alpha$ versus [\ion{O}{iii}]/H$\beta$, we can only use the emission-line fluxes derived from our MUSE datacubes, as the lines necessary for gauging the hardness of the ionizing radiation field are outside the spectral range of VIMOS. Only two MUSE galaxies have detections of the necessary emission lines: IC 1459 and NGC 1316. Both occupy very similar positions in the BPT plots, on or close to the boundary between the Seyfert 2 and LINER classes. On the whole, the central bins tend to be on the LINER side.

To show the expected position of LINERs on the SAURON plot, the MAPPINGS-III shock model grid of \citet{Allen2008} is shown in green. The solid lines are lines of constant shock velocity (from 150 to 1000\,$\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) and the dotted lines are lines of constant magnetic parameter $b \equiv B/\sqrt{n}$ (from 0.5 to 4.0), where $B$ is the magnetic field strength and $N$ the (pre-shock) particle number density \citep{Dopita1996}. All models assume an electron density of $n_\mathrm{e} = 1\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\label{fig:SAURON}}

		\citet{Sarzi2010} showed that Seyferts, LINERs and star-forming galaxies are reasonable separated in the SAURON diagnostic plot. To exploit the VIMOS datacubes we thus use the [\ion{N}{ii}]\,--\,[\ion{N}{i}] relation derived in Section \ref{subsec:Ndec}, along with the Balmer decrement, to transform the \citet{Kewley2001} extreme starburst and the \citet{Kauffmann2003a} pure star-formation boundaries in the [\ion{N}{ii}]/H$\alpha$ versus [\ion{O}{iii}]/H$\beta$ plot to boundaries in the SAURON plot. For the MUSE datacubes, only IC 1459 and NGC 1316 have detections of [\ion{N}{i}]. Given that we already have the superior classic BPT plots for these galaxies, we only show the VIMOS-derived SAURON diagnostic plot. This is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:SAURON} for all 6 VIMOS galaxies with detectable, spatially-resolved emission lines. All exhibit LINER-AGN behaviour.

		NGC 3100 appears to occupy to distinct regions in the SAURON diagnostic plot (Fig.\ \ref{fig:SAURON}). If the ionization is due to shocks from the impact of the jet, then using the shock models of \citet{Allen2008}, we can see that the right-hand group of bins have been ionized by a higher shock velocity that the left-hand group. As can be seen in Fig.\ \ref{fig:ngc3100_NI_Hb}, these bins are directly in the gap (presumable created by the jet blowing a hole) in the CO ring.

		\end{figure}

		The final spatially-resolved line ratio diagnostic plot that we use is that of the equivalent width of H$\alpha$ versus $\log([\text{\ion{N}{ii}}]/H\alpha)$, known as the WHaN2 plot \citep{CidFernandes2011}. We interpret the strong AGN, weak AGN and retired regions on this plot as Seyfert 2, LINER-AGN and LIER classifications, respectively. Passive (i.e.\ line-less) galaxies are marked with crosses instead of circles. Fig.\,\ref{fig:WHaN2} shows the WHaN2 plot for the MUSE derived emission lines of IC 4296 where almost all the bins fall within the weak AGN (LINER-AGN) class. This is consistent with the measurements from the VIMOS observations of the IC 4296 as shown in the SAURON diagnostic plot, where IC 4296 is well within the shocks grid (i.e.\ LINERs; see Fig.\ \ref{fig:SAURON}). We do not include IC 1459 and NGC 1316, as they have already been classified via the classic BPT plots (see Section \ref{subsec:BPT}). 

		For the emission lines measured from the VIMOS datacubes, we use H$\beta$ as a proxy for H$\alpha$ and [\ion{N}{i}] as a proxy for [\ion{N}{ii}] utilising the relations found in Section \ref{subsec:Ndec} to transform the classification boundaries (see Section \ref{subsec:Ndec}). We call the resulting diagnostic plot the WHbN1 plot, shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:WHbN1}. While in Section \ref{subsec:BPT} (Fig.\,\ref{fig:SAURON}) we showed that most of these galaxies had line ratios consistent with being ionized by shocks such as in LINER-like galaxies, Fig.\,\ref{fig:WHbN1} shows that for IC 1459 and NGC 3100, the ionizing photons originate from the AGN.

		\end{figure}
		
		As discussed in Section \ref{sec:ETG}, many galaxies classified as LINERs are in fact LIERs \citep[see e.g.][]{Sarzi2005, Sarzi2010, Singh2013, Belfiore2016}, i.e.\ the source of the ionizing radiation is not concentrated in the nuclear regions of the galaxies. As we can see from Figs.\ref{fig:BPT} and \ref{fig:SAURON}, most bins of a given galaxy are tightly grouped together on the BPT plots. To check if the ionizing radiation is entirely due to an AGN throughout the host galaxy, we plot the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ flux radial profiles for the MUSE and VIMOS data in Figs.\,\ref{fig:Ha_profile_MUSE} and \ref{fig:Hb_profile_VIMOS}, respectively. A point source, such as an AGN, will result in a profile having a $r^{-2}$ shape, where $r$ is the distance of the bin from the galaxy centre. A shallower profile points to a spatially-extended source, presumably non-circumnuclear stellar processes such as star formation or radiation from pAGB stars (see Section \ref{subsubsec:JetFeedback}), as the dominant cause of the ionization in the outer parts of the galaxy (i.e.\ LIER rather than LINER). All the galaxies with spatially-extended Balmer emission in our Southern Sample revel a central point source as the dominant source of the ionizing photons. The H$\beta$ profile of NGC 612 has a larger scatter suggesting that stellar processes also have some impact (likely radiation from pAGB stars, as these galaxies are ETGs and therefore likely have low star-formation rates).

The VIMOS and MUSE data points of IC 1459 are linked with a black dashed line. Classification boundaries are from \citet{Nyland2016}.}
			\label{fig:MEx}
		\end{figure}

		The mass\,--\,excitation (MEx) plot of \citet{Juneau2011} is useful to classify galaxies with intermediate excitation levels ($0.5 < \mathrm{[\ion{O}{iii}]/H\,\beta} < 8.0$), particularly as it does not depend on faint lines such as the [\ion{N}{I}] doublet. We use here the calibrations by \citet{Nyland2016}, including an attempt to separate LINERs powered by AGN from those powered by pAGB stars (the former have [\ion{O}{iii}] equivalent widths $>0.8$\,\AA). We use an aperture of 3\arcsec\ to plot the nuclear MEx for our Southern Sample galaxies, and the resulting diagnostic plot is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:MEx}. 



\section{Discussion}
	\label{sec:gasDiscussion}
	In the previous subsections we have shown that galaxies in our Southern Sample have ionized gas masses of $10^4$\,--\,$10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. These are at the upper limit of, and possibly exceed, the typical masses observed in ETGs, although given that our sample contains particularly massive galaxies, high ionized gas masses are not unexpected. 

	The only slow rotator with detected, spatially-extended ionized gas, IC 1459, shows evidence through gas\,--\,star kinematic misalignment that the gas has an external origin, although it is possible that the gas has been re-accreted after it was first ejected during the merger that resulted in the stellar KDC. 

	Of the other 3 galaxies with detected, spatially-extended ionized gas (NGC 612, NGC 1316 and NGC 3100, all fast rotators), we find that one, NGC 3100, again has kinematic evidence of an external gas origin; another, NGC 612, is consistent with an internal origin; while the situation for the last one (NGC 1316) is not clear, although is definitely not in a settled disc. This is in keeping with the findings of \citet{Davis2011a}, who showed that $36\pm5$\% of fast rotators have ionized gas kinematics misaligned with respect to the stellar kinematics, while slow rotators have a flat distribution with respect to their misalignment angles. This indicates that slow rotators are dominated by external sources of gas, while fast rotators can have either internal or external sources. 

	All galaxies with detectable emission lines in our Southern Sample show LINER or Seyfert 2 characteristics. The only Seyfert 2 in our sample is the fast rotator, IC 1531. This is consistent with the results of \citet{Nyland2016}, who showed that all ETGs in the Atlas$^\text{3D}$ sample classified as Seyferts are also fast rotators. We find 9 of the 11 galaxies to be LINERs, 5 of which we conclusively attribute the ionizing photons to the central AGN. The final galaxy, PKS 718-34 has no emission line detections (i.e.\ passive). 

	Overall, we thus find that the properties of our Southern Sample galaxies are consistent with those of radio-detected, jet-mode AGN. These are ordinary ETGs experiencing an active phase, presumably due to the central black holes currently accreting gas in some form.
