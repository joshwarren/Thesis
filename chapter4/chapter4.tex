\chapter{Stellar Component}
	\label{cha:stellar}


The rest of this chapter is structured as follows: firstly we present the kinematic maps for the stellar component of the galaxy (section \ref{sec:stellarKin}) and a look at how they fit on the $\lambda_{R_e}$--ellipticity plane, then, in section \ref{sec:pop} we investigate the stellar populations using the absorption line strength. We conclude by looking at the odd-one-out of the sample NGC 612 in section \ref{sec:NGC612}

		Figures \ref{fig:VIMOS_stellar} and \ref{fig:MUSE_stellar} show the stellar LOSVD with associated uncertainties for all VIMOS and MUSE datacubes. 

		The kinematics of the sample are classified according to the Regular-Rotator/Non Regular-Rotator (RR/NRR) regime given in \citet{Krajnovic2011}, Fast/Slow Rotator (FR/SR) regime given in \citet{Cappellari2016} (originally defined by \citet{Emsellem2011}, but later refined by \citet{Cappellari2016}). This classification is shown on the $\lambda_{R_e}$--ellipticity plane in figure \ref{fig:lambdaR_ellip}. Beyond this attempts have been made to use the kinematic features as defined in \citet{Krajnovic2011}, however the quality of the data has meant that many have had to be classified by eye as the artifacts from the VIMOS quadrants confuse any ellipse fitting methods. For VIMOS maps, the classifications are done by eye. These classifications are given in table \ref{tab:classify}.

		Using the combined samples of Atlas3D and MASSIVE, we find that there is no discernible difference between the radio selected Southern Sample and the optically selected ETGs of Atlas3D and MASSIVE, once the differences in mass distribution are taken into account. To do this we find the fraction of slow rotators in each mass bin (using $M_k$ as a proxy), shown in black in the lower panel of figure \ref{fig:SRmassFraction}. We using this and the distribution in mass of the Southern Sample (red in upper panel of \ref{fig:SRmassFraction}) to estimate that we should expect $(64 \pm 6)\%$ of the Southern Sample to be slow rotators. This is consistent with out finding of 56\% slow rotators.

\section{Stellar Population}
	\label{sec:pop}

	\subsection{Absorption line strengths}
		Figures \ref{fig:VIMOS_absorption} and \ref{fig:MUSE_absorption} show the resolved absorption line strengths for the Southern Sample. For the VIMOS cubes, we find G4300, Fe4383, Ca4455, Fe4531, H$_\beta$, Fe5015 and Mg$_b$. For the most distant galaxies, the continuum band for Mg$_b$ is redshifted beyond the range of the VIMOS spectrograph. In these cases, we have avoided unnecessary systematics, by not calculating Mg$_b$. For MUSE cubes, we find H$_\beta$, Fe5015, Mg$_b$, Fe5270, Fe5335, Fe5406, Fe5709, Fe5782, NaD, TiO1 and TiO2. Each index is defined in table \ref{tab:abIndex}.

	Comparisons to the literature is made difficult by the inhomogeneous nature of corrections applied: such as accounting for H$_\beta$ emission or velocity dispersion. There is also a lack of non-LICK/IDS system measurements: we used the empirical functions provided by \citet{} to translate between LICK/IDS and LIS systems. Finally, we noticed that the [OIII] emission line is not corrected for in most of the literature, despite often being the strongest emission line for ETGs. This effects the reliability of the Fe5015 absorption index as the [OIII] doublet falls with on component in the index band and one in the blue continuum band, provided the gas does not have wildly different kinematics to the stars. Table \ref{tab:litAbsorption} sums up our comparisons to the literature. Here we note that in the case of comparisons to \citet{Rampazzo2005}, the offset was rather large until we corrected to the same dispersions that they had used. For the sake of assessing the quality of our pipeline we use the same corrections as \citet{Rampazzo2005}, but we suggest that their analysis may contain flaws from using inaccurate velocity dispersions and only correcting for the H$_\beta$ emission line. For the comparison to \citet{Vazdekis2010}, we analyzed the SAURON data set\footnote{SARUON data is available at: http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/sauron/} \citep{Emsellem2004} using the same pipeline we have developed for our sample.

	\subsection{Most-likely stellar population model}
		Figures \ref{fig:VIMOS_pop} and \ref{fig:MUSE_pop} show the mostly stellar populations for the Southern Sample, assuming that they can resonably represented by a single stellar population (SSP). In general they show old, metal poor SSPs: very typical for ETGs. The exception is NGC 612 which is discussed in more detail in section \ref{sec:NGC612}. Some ideas around the fueling of the AGN suggest that star formation would play a role in modulating the flow of gas into the central black hole \citep{}, and while it would be expected to be small in scale, spatially, we might resonably expect a young SSP to dominate in the very central (1-2) spaxels. We note that these maps show no evidence of this.

	\subsection{Kinematically Decoupled Cores}
		\label{sec:popKDC}

		\citet{Kuntschner2010} found that KDCs exist in two forms: they are either small or contain an old stellar population. The three definite KDCs found in the Southern Sample fit into this pattern, all with old stellar populations and varying sizes. It is worth noting that in many cases we would not resolve any of the small KDCs: they would be 1 spaxel in size. Figure \ref{fig:KDC} shows the KDC size -- age relation including the Southern Sample. KDC size is the radius at which $k_1$ goes to zero at the boundary between inner and outer components. Age is the age of the most-likely model for the inner 1 arcsec.

\section{The case of NGC 612}
	\label{sec:NGC612}
	All of the galaxies show typical ETG behavior: old, metal poor stellar populations with dispersion dominated stellar kinematics; with the exception of NGC 612. This galaxy has very high rotational velocities for an ETG, with an extended CO disk and a young stellar population. All this suggests that NGC 612 must have a very different history to the rest of the Southern Sample. Indeed, the CO and ionized gas disks are more representative of LTGs, rather than ETGs. With this in mind, we tentatively suggest that NGC 612 may be a very edge-on spiral galaxy and not intrinsically an ETG at all. Having said that, it is worth noting that spiral galaxies with radio jets, particularly on the scale of NGC 612's jets are very rare with only a handful of known cases \citep{}.
