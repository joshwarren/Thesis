\chapter{Stellar Component}
	\label{cha:stellar}


The rest of this chapter is structured as follows: firstly we present the kinematic maps for the stellar component of the galaxy (section \ref{sec:stellarKin}) and a look at how they fit on the $\lambda_{R_e}$--ellipticity plane, then, in section \ref{sec:pop} we investigate the stellar populations using the absorption line strength. We conclude by looking at the odd-one-out of the sample NGC 612 in section \ref{sec:NGC612}

\section{Kinematics}

	\subsection{Maps}

		Figures \ref{fig:Vstellar_img} - \ref{fig:Mstellar_sigma_uncert} show the stellar LOSVD with associated uncertainties for all VIMOS and MUSE datacubes. 

		The kinematics of the sample are classified according to the Regular-Rotator/Non Regular-Rotator (RR/NRR) regime given in \citet{Krajnovic2011}, Fast/Slow Rotator (FR/SR) regime given in \citet{Cappellari2016} (originally defined by \citet{Emsellem2011}, but later refined by \citet{Cappellari2016}). This classification is shown on the $\lambda_{R_e}$--ellipticity plane in figure \ref{fig:lambdaR_ellip}. Beyond this attempts have been made to use the kinematic features as defined in \citet{Krajnovic2011}, however the quality of the data has meant that many have had to be classified by eye as the artifacts from the VIMOS quadrants confuse any ellipse fitting methods. For VIMOS maps, the classifications are done by eye. These classifications are given in table \ref{tab:classify}.

Where we have MUSE datacubes, the value and classifications from this are given (since they rely on less extrapolation due to the larger field of view of MUSE), otherwise the values are from the VIMOS maps.

The theoretic limit of disk dominated galaxy is shown (solid magenta) with lines of constant intrinsic angular moment with varying inclination (dashed magenta).

		There are no discernible differences between the Southern Sample and the Atlas3D sample in terms of the fast/slow rotator fraction when the differences in mass is taken into account. % Justify this.

		\label{sec:popKDC}

		\citet{Kuntschner2010} found that KDCs exsit in two forms: they are either small or contain an old stellar population. The three definate KDCs found in the Southern Sample fit into this pattern, all with old stellar populations and varing sizes. It is worth noting that in many cases we would not resolve any of the small KDCs: they would be 1 spaxel in size. Figure \ref{fig:KDC} shows the KDC size -- age relation including the Southern Sample. KDC size is the radius at which $k_1$ goes to zero at the boundary between inner and outer components. Age is the age of the most-likely model for the inner 1 arcsec.
